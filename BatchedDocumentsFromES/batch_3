Life was good, until the Great Recession of 2008. The housing crisis hit, new regulations turned the mortgage industry upside down, and Ambauen-Meade began some serious soul searching.  Ambauen-Meade had been raising chickens for a long time. She mixed her own chicken feed because she wasnt comfortable feeding them the commercial feed that was highly processed into pellets instead of naturally formed, like grain. At the request of friends, and soon friends of friends, the idea for Scratch and Peck Feeds blossomed. Ambauen-Meade knew that delivering the feed door-to-door wasnt a sustainable distribution option, so she came up with a plan. She started contacting area retailers, letting them know that she already had clientele buying directly from her in their location. She told the retailers if they would carry her product, shed send those customers to their stores instead of selling to them direct. She said, The response was pretty amazing. Our customers have been great promoters for us. Although people can buy our product online, we really use our website for education to help people care for their animals and to explain the value of organic feed. Its another way we can stay connected with our community. Although people can buy our product online, we really use our website for education to help people care for their animals and to explain the value of organic feed. Its another way we can stay connected with our community. In 2012, Scratch and Peck became the first non-GMO project-verified feed manufacturer in North America. In 2013, its feed qualified as certified organic making it the first product of its kind to hold both designations. The company has also expanded its product line, now mixing feed for other types of livestock, as well as producing supplements and fermenting kits. Although a lot has changed throughout the years, one thing that hasnt is the companys commitment to the land, the organic movement, and American farmers. We could buy lower-cost grain from China or India, but we are committed to supporting the American farmers who are doing the hard work of growing grains organically and to paying them a fair-trade wage. They are amazing stewards of the land,Ambauen-Meade said. Ambauen-Meade was thrilled to find out that Scratch and Peck Feeds not only made it to the top 100 of the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest, but also was selected as a top ten grant winner. Its always great to be recognized for the work you do, particularly if its something youre passionate about, Ambauen-Meade said. Thats a great feeling. We could buy lower-cost grain from China or India, but we are committed to supporting the American farmers who are doing the hard work of growing grains organically and to paying them a fair-trade wage. They are amazing stewards of the land. Shell use the grant money in two different ways. Her first priority is her employees. She plans to use part of the money to provide some team-building opportunities and the other part to purchase new machines that will make sample packets automatically to reduce labor impact. In less than a decade, Scratch and Peck has grown from a personal mission into a booming business with a loyal customer base.  Learnings Running a small business is a process with lessons learned along the way. Those lessons can come in the form of corrected mistakes or good decisions that ended up being great decisions or unexpected victories.

Veterans own 7.2% of the nations 5.5 million businesses with employees, according to latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Still, new businesses need assistance at some point, and thats where small-business grants, loans and other financing resources for veterans come into play.

VBOCs provide business training, counseling and mentoring at 15 locations throughout the country.

<TITLE>Crowdfunding for Business: What You Need to Know - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Creating a fundraising campaign on a crowdfunding platform can help you get financing. Crowdfunding allows entrepreneurs to tap into the power of the internet to raise money for their small businesses. It not only gives business owners a relatively inexpensive way to bankroll a fledgling business idea,it also helps promote a companys product or service on social media and build a base of enthusiastic customers. Setting up a crowdfunding campaign is simple:You use a crowdfunding platform to create a profile for your business, project or service, set a funding goal and publish your request online. Interestedpeople can then give cash donations to your cause, often in exchange for company assets in the form of rewards or equity. Sharing links to your listing can generate further interest and more funding. For small-business owners, the benefits of crowdfunding are twofold: You find financing for your business and get the word out about your product or service. Think of crowdfunding like networking on steroids. Instead of attending events with a limited number people to drum up support for your business, you reach a broader group of potential investors. This often starts within your own social sphere as you share your request with family and friends via social networks. Its also more of a grant than a loan, because you dont have to pay back the funds or worry aboutinterest rates. Female entrepreneurs tend to have more success with crowdfunding platforms than their male counterparts. According to "Women Unbound: Unleashing female entrepreneurial potential," a reportfrom PwC and the Crowdfunding Center,women across the globe are 32% more likely to reach their financing goals using crowdfunding than men. The report suggests that crowdfunding levels the playing field for women because it opens financing to investors outside of traditionally male-dominated venture capitalist firms. Women also tend to use more personal language in their pitches, which helps foster emotional connections, while men take a more formal approach, often using business jargon. Still, as the report found, crowdfunding is not guaranteed cash just 22% of campaigns led by women reached their financing goals. You dont know exactly how much financing youll walk away with, and if you dont hit your funding goal, that amount could be zero. The two most common types of crowdfunding for small business owners are rewards-based and equity-based. In rewards-based crowdfunding, donors receive a product or service related to the project, with the value depending on the amount donated. For instance, a $5 donation might be rewarded with a handwritten thank you card, while $50 or $100 mightbring early access to your companys product or service. Rewards-based crowdfunding is a good idea for small business owners looking to get their business off the ground without being beholden to shareholders or weighed down by loan repayments. Rewards-based crowdfunding platforms: Kickstarter, Indiegogo Inequity-based crowdfunding, donors receive shares in the company; the number is based on the amount of the contribution. Contributors choose to invest in companies they believe will be successful in the future, as the success of the company directly influences the return on donors' investments. This method of crowdfunding is a good idea for small businesses with solid growth plans. Youll be left with investors in your company, which could result in potential hiccups, including increased scrutiny from regulators. Equity-based crowdfunding platforms: Republic, CircleUp, Crowdfunder Fundable, a crowdfunding site specifically for small businesses, allows you to choose between equity- and rewards-based funding. Your business stands out in a crowd: A successful crowdfunding campaign relies on your ability to capture potential investors interest. It means you have a unique product that fills a consumer void and a strong personal or business story that compels investors to give you a chance. Investors value your reward: Youll want to make sure you offer either equity or a reward that is compelling enough to capture interest. You have a wide network: Having family and friends willing to support and promote your cause can amplify your fundraising efforts. Without a strong promotional base, it's harder to reach your financing goals. Crowdfunding may workto secure startup financing and generate buzz about your product, but its not a solution for long-term business financing. There are many ways to fund your business; here are a few popular options: For small-business financing, traditional lenders like banks and credit unions are a great starting point. A loan from a bank or credit union requires a good credit score and comes with an interest payment, but creating a relationship with your local bank can be beneficial for future financing needs. If you dont qualify for a bank loan, consider small business loans from online lenders, which may have looser qualification requirements. However, the cost of borrowing can be high, with some lenders offering APRs that reach into the triple digits. A business credit card gives you access to a revolving line of credit you can use for current and future business expenses. It can also build your business credit, making you more appealing to future lenders. If your business history is too short to qualify for a bank loan or business credit card, consider a personal loan to fund your business. Loan amountsmay be smaller, but also rates can be lower for well-qualified borrowers. Updated Disclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

<TITLE>Small-Business Grants for Women: 10 Go-To Spots - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. From the federal government to economic development agencies, here's a list of business grants for women. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. Small-business grants for women entrepreneurs are essentially free financing, as opposed to business credit cards or small-business loans that you must pay back. Understandably, the competition for small-business grants is fierce, and it takes considerable time and effort to win them. But if youre up for the challenge, the payoff can be worth it. Here are 10 places women entrepreneurs can look for small-business grants and financial resources.  MORE: Small-business grants Some federal government grants for small-business owners are designated for specific purposes, such as research and development projects, or for businesses in rural areas. Government grants typically must be used for purposes other than startup costs or day-to-day expenses. Grants.gov is a database of federally sponsored grants, including grants for small businesses. To apply, you must obtain a DUNS number for your business (a unique nine-digit identification number), register to do business with the U.S. government through its System Award Managementwebsite, and create an account at Grants.gov. To view grants specifically for small businesses, filter the results on the left side of the page under eligibility. The SBA facilitates these two competitive programs, which provide grants to small businesses that contribute to federal research and development. Twelve federal agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Defense, and Health and Human Services, post grant opportunities on their websites. You can search current grant opportunities on the SBIR website. To qualify, you must operate a for-profit business with no more than 500 employees and meet other eligibility requirements. Launched in 2014by entrepreneur Sophia Amoruso, theGirlboss Foundation awards grants twice a year to female and female-identifying entrepreneurs. Each grant recipient receives funding of $15,000. Grants are exclusive to female business owners working in design, fashion, music and the arts. Selections are judged by creativity and innovation, business acumen and planning, and demonstration of a financial need.  MORE: Find small-business grants for veterans Because federal small-business grants are limited in number and often very competitive, you may have better luck looking for grants at the state and municipal levels. Youll have to do your own research to pinpoint specific grant programs in your area, but here are some places to look: The SBA sponsors about 100 Womens Business Centers nationwide, designed to help women entrepreneurs with business development and access to capital. Some, such as the California Capital Financial Development Corp., lend money directly, while others help you find small-business grants and loans that you may qualify for. Every state and many cities have economic development resources focused on promoting strong local economies. For example, California has several economic development districts, such as the Superior California Economic Development District, which provides financing to local entrepreneurs. There are hundreds of SBA-sponsored Small Business Development Centers around the country, typically housed at colleges and universities. SBDCs offer free, one-on-one business consulting, including help with developing a business plan, researching markets and finding financing. Some private organizations and businesses offer national grant programs for women small-business owners. Here are two to consider: The Amber Grant Foundation awards $10,000 to a different women-owned business every month. At the end of each year, one of the 12 grant winners is awarded an additional $25,000. The application is relatively simple: Explain your business, describe what youd do with the grant money and pay a $15 application fee. The foundations advisory board chooses the winners, looking for women with passion and a good story. Businesses operating in the U.S. and Canada are eligible. Eileen Fisher, a womens clothing retailer, awards a total of $100,000 to up to 10 women business owners each year. To be eligible, women must make up at least 51% of your businesss ownership and leadership, your business must have been in operation for at least three years, earn less than $1 million in annual revenue, and be focused on environmental or social change.  MORE: Find small-business grants for minorities These options arent specifically for women, but theyre good small-business grants to consider: FedEx awards up to $25,000 apiece to 10 small businesses annually. In 2017, the contest provided a total prize pool of $120,500. Winners also receive money to use toward FedEx Office print and business services. The application requires an explanation of your business, how youd use the money, photos of your business and this part is optional a short video explaining your business. To be eligible, you must operate a for-profit business with fewer than 99 employees and at least six months of operating history. This nonprofit trade association awards $4,000 per month in growth grants to small businesses that can be used for a variety of business needs, including marketing, advertising and hiring employees.

<TITLE>Debt vs. Equity Financing: What Option Is Best for You? - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. You can get financing for a business by taking on debt or selling its equity. Small-business owners generally have two basic funding options: debt financing and equity financing. Debt financing is when you borrow money, often via a small-business loan, which you repay with interest. Equity financing is when you take money from an investor in exchange for partial ownership of your company. Both options provide cash, but each has pros and cons. Debt financing can be expensive, especially if you have bad credit. While equity financing requires giving up a stake in your company and giving investors input in business decisions. The best financing for your business will be the one that supports your companys goals and financial needs, now and in the future. You can qualify. Getting a business loan isnt always easy, especially for startups in need of financing. Lenders often require a certain length of time in business, solid credit, strong financials and some type of collateral. If you meet those criteria, you may get a competitive interest rate. You expect a positive return. For example, debt financing could be worth it if you take out $200,000 with an 8% annual percentage rate but project a return of 15%. Another positive: Repaying debt can build your business credit, which can lead to better rates and returns in the future. Youre comfortable with the risk. If you put up collateral, failing to repay the debt could cost you that asset. Even if the debt is unsecured, your credit score will be at risk, and items like your home or car could be too if the lender requires a personal guarantee. You want to maximize your money. Debt financing may have more long-term financial benefits than equity financing. With equity financing, investors will be entitled to profits, and if you sell the company, theyll get some of the proceeds too. This reduces the amount of money you could earn by owning the company outright.  MORE: How to get a small business loan in five steps You want to avoid debt. Equity financing may be less risky than debt financing because you dont have a loan to repay or collateral at stake. Debt also requires regular repayments, which can hurt your companys cash flow and its ability to grow. Youre a startup or not yet profitable. Equity financing may be necessary if you cant qualify for a startup business loan and want to avoid more expensive options like credit cards. Just make sure the investment is a fair valuation since your business is young. You can find a partner or mentor. Investors can offer working capital to build your company. But their industry knowledge or experience could prove just as valuable, especially if they take an active role in your businesss growth and success. Youre OK giving up some control. An investor who owns a large-enough stake is entitled to voting rights and could insist on actions like electing new directors. If you eventually give up more than 50% of ownership, you can lose complete control of your company. To regain it, youd likely have to buy out investors which may get expensive.  MORE:How equity crowdfunding can help your startup If you want to finance your company with debt, here are some common types of small-business loans: Term loans can have high borrowing limits and may be a good choice if youre looking to expand and have good credit and strong earnings. Business lines of credit offer a flexible way to meet short-term financing needs for example, if you need to purchase inventory or fix broken equipment. Invoice factoring can turn unpaid invoices into fast cash and may be an option for startups with bad credit because the invoices themselves act as collateral. Business credit cards can help cover ongoing expenses and may be necessary if youre a startup that cant qualify for a loan. Personal loans for business are another option for new businesses that want to hang on to equity, but rates depend on your credit score and can be expensive.  MORE: Best business credit cards for startups Here are some small-business financing options that can rely on equity: Venture capital may come from a single person or a firm that invests from a pool of money. VCs are more likely to offer financing to established businesses than startups and will often require a seat on the board of directors, plus equity. Angel investors are individuals who use their own money to offer businesses financing. They typically invest in startups with high earning potential, which means they may be more likely to take a risk if the return looks promising. Family and friends. Getting in front of a VC or angel investor can be difficult; earning an investment is even harder. You may have better luck getting equity financing from family and friends. But if you lose their money, your relationship could be at risk.  MORE: SBA loans: What they are and how to qualify If you want to finance a small business with debt, you can apply for a loan from many places, including banks, credit unions, online lenders and the U.S. Small Business Administration. To raise equity financing, one option is a private placement offering or an unregistered offering. Such an offering wouldnt qualify as a public sale of securities, so you wouldnt need to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission or report financial information. However, you would need to meet certain SEC requirements. Things can get complicated, so consult a tax professional and a securities lawyer before pursuing this option. Equity crowdfunding platforms are another way to get your business in front of investors. These sites let you promote your company to raise capital. Platforms include EquityNet and Fundable. The SBA also licenses and funds Small Business Investment Companies, or SBICs. SBICs offer debt and equity financing, and you can find a directory of options on the SBA's website.

But how do you go from that killer idea to actually building a business? Making It Work puts you in a room with people who want to kick out conventional wisdom and take you through the highs and lows of running a company. This is not a podcast just about success stories. So if youre a self-starter and you want it straight, this is the series created for you. Ready to listen? Click an episode link below and listen now on SoundCloud. How Are Small Businesses Staying Alive? Sales slump or off the charts? The coronavirus has impacted small businesses in so many ways. How are our entrepreneurs coping? What are they learning? In the first of a two-part special we talk to four founders about steering their business through a global health crisis. How Do You Run a Business During Lockdown? As the world begins to face the reality of a post-pandemic existence, small business owners are still working out how to operate safely. So how do you run a company under the constraints of coronavirus? And will things ever go back to how they were? How Are the Entrepreneurs Four Months On? In the third episode we never planned to make, we check in on the four entrepreneurs to see how they're weathering the COVID-19 storm. Have any temporary measures brought about lasting changes? And will it be enough to save their businesses?  When you should just give up  How to scale your business  How to take on your competitors  How to hold onto your employees  Where to find investors  Product promotion in the 21st century Working with foreign factories Working with friends and family How to fire your employees When to start paying yourself Back in 2017, a team from FedEx Digital International traveled from their home in Amsterdam to Memphis to meet some of the USA's brightest entrepreneurs all handpicked for the FedEx Entrepreneur Advisory Board. Amazed by the amount of knowledge these small business owners had to share, we returned to Europe determined to give them a bigger platform. Making It Work was born somewhere between Tennessee and the Netherlands and is designed to be a podcast that levels out the learning curve for entrepreneurs everywhere. Shark Wheel Edge Entity AnaOno The Groomsman Suit Want to get to know the entrepreneurs and their businesses a little better? Kelli (the one you hear first) is a super passionate marketeer and small business advocate she lives in Memphis. Tom (asking the questions) is a digital creative who loves to dig a little deeper he lives in Amsterdam. It sounds like the beginning of a transatlantic love story but instead ends with an awesome podcast. There are loads of other people involved in Making It Work, so a big shoutout to everyone behind the scenes in the Netherlands and across the pond in the U.S. When the person asking the questions is in the Netherlands and your guests are scattered across North America, interviews can be tricky. So we thought, If they cant come to our studio, why dont we send it to them? Thats how we came up with our portable podcast studio, which was sent to our entrepreneurs one by one (and boy, has it clocked some miles).

The Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, is amending the Formula Grants Program implementing regulation authorized under title II, part B, of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDP Act) and promulgated in 1996, to remove sections and/or provisions that were rendered obsolete by amendments made to the JJDP Act in 2002 or in 2018; are redundant; or are ultra vires. Additional technical corrections reflect an editorial reclassification of the United States Code, implemented on September 1, 2017, that reorganized certain existing provisions of the United States Code into a new title, and citations are updated to reflect sections of the Act that were re-numbered by the 2002 amendments. Finally, the definitions in the regulation have been rearranged to be listed in alphabetical order. This rule is effective June 11, 2021. Keith Towery, Grants Management Specialist, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, at 202-307-0648. The purpose of this regulatory action is to amend the Formula Grants Program implementing regulation at 28 CFR part 31, subpart A, authorized under title II, part B, of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDP Act) and promulgated in 1996, to remove sections and/or provisions that (1) were rendered obsolete by amendments made to the JJDP Act in 2002 by Public Law 107-273 (the 2002 amendments) or by Public Law 115-385 (the 2018 amendments); (2) are redundant; or (3) are ultra vires. Additional technical corrections reflect an editorial reclassification of the United States Code, implemented on September 1, 2017, that reorganized certain existing provisions of the United States Code from title 42 into a new title 34, and citations are updated to reflect sections of the Act that were re-numbered by the 2002 amendments. Finally, the definitions in the regulation have been rearranged to be listed in alphabetical order.[1] OJP implements this rule pursuant to the rulemaking authority under 34 U.S.C. 11111. As noted in the preamble above, this rule removes provisions of the Formula Grants Program regulation that (1) were rendered obsolete by amendments made to the JJDP Act in 2002 by Public Law 107-273 (the 2002 amendments) or by Public Law 115-385 (the 2018 amendments); (2) are redundant; or (3) are ultra vires. This rule also makes technical corrections to the regulation. These changes, overall, reasonably can be expected to save at least a de minimis amount of grantee staff time in understanding program requirements when compared to the current rule, and thus the rule is deregulatory. With respect to the provisions of the Formula Grants Program regulation to be removed as obsolete, States have been advised by OJJDP not to follow those provisions, and/or OJJDP has not been enforcing those provisions. Thus, removing those provisions will result in no additional or reduced burden on states. The removal of provisions that are redundant, because they simply parrot language in the JJDPA, do not impose or reduce requirements of state grantees, and accordingly neither increase nor decrease costs or burdens on states. This rule makes technical corrections to the Formula Grants Program regulation that reflect the 2002 and 2018 amendments, most of which reflect simple renumbering of sections or provisions of the JJDPA, but do not make changes that would impose additional requirements on states. Finally, the three provisions in the regulation that are being removed as ultra vires have not been enforced by OJJDP in recent years; their removal will not result in any additional costs, and may result in de minimis savings in grantee staff time, as noted above. This rule amends the regulation implementing the JJDP Act Formula Grants Program at 28 CFR part 31, subpart A. OJJDP administers the Formula Grants Program, pursuant to title II, part B, of the JJDP Act, now codified at 34 U.S.C. 11131-11133, which authorizes OJJDP to provide an annual grant to each State to improve its juvenile justice system and to support juvenile delinquency prevention programs. Title II, part B, of the JJDP Act authorizes OJJDP to provide formula grants to states to assist them in planning, establishing, operating, coordinating, and evaluating projects directly or through grants and contracts with public and private agencies for the development of more effective education, training, research, prevention, diversion, treatment, and rehabilitation programs in the area of juvenile delinquency and programs to improve the juvenile justice system. The JJDP Act was originally enacted in 1974, authorizing the Formula Grants Program under title II, part B, and was reauthorized and/or amended in 1980,[2] 1984,[3] 1988,[4] 1992,[5] 2002,[6] and 2018.[7] It should be noted that this final rule, which is purely technical in character, does not reflect amendments made by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-385), unless they are purely technical in nature, or reflect provisions that were rendered obsolete. Any substantive changes will be made in a future regulation that will be published for notice and public comment. OJP's Formula Grants Program implementing regulation was first published on May 31, 1995, and amended on December 31, 1996. In the 2002 amendments to the JJDP Act, several statutory provisions were repealed, but those statutory amendments were not reflected in the only post-1996 amendment to the implementing regulation (promulgated in January 2017). This final rule, among other things, amends the regulation to reflect the repeal, in 2002, of those statutory provisions, as well as the repeal of statutory provisions based on the 2018 amendments. Finally, it should be noted that many provisions that currently exist in this regulation have been superseded by 2 CFR part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards), references to which are to be understood as references to part 200 as adopted for the Department of Justice by 28 CFR part 2800. In addition, it should be noted that, among other things, title II Start Printed Page 31153of the JJDP Act adopts by reference certain provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, making them applicable to the title II Formula Grants Program. See 34 U.S.C. 11182(b) and (c). These referenced provisions include, but are not limited to, the provisions found at 34 U.S.C. 10228(c) (prohibition on discrimination); 34 U.S.C. 10230(a) (recordkeeping requirement); 34 U.S.C. 10230(b) (access to records for audit and examination); 34 U.S.C. 10230(c) (audit and examination period after completion of program or project); 34 U.S.C. 10231(a) (research or statistical information; immunity from process; prohibition against admission as evidence or use in any proceedings). The current regulation prescribes requirements that were pertinent to Formula Grants Program requirements that were repealed in the 2002 and 2018 amendments. Those provisions of the current regulation that purport to implement requirements that were repealed by the 2002 and 2018 statutory amendments are not valid. See, e.g., Hadson Gas Sys., Inc. v. FERC, 316 U.S. App. D.C. 98, 75 F.3d 680, 684 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (where Congress enacts a new statute or amends an existing one, administrative regulations may be rendered unnecessary or obsolete and the prior regulations need not be repealed by notice and comment); Messick ex rel. Kangas v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. 319, 328 (2006) (holding that a regulation that had failed to keep up with statutory changes was to be disregarded), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Amber-Messick ex rel. Kangas v. United States, 483 F.3d 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Several sections of the Formula Grants Program regulation do no more than parrot existing statutory provisions within the JJDP Act or provisions such as those in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 that are noted above, and thus are unnecessarily repeated in the regulation. The following three provisions of the regulation are being removed because they are contrary to specific provisions within the JJDP Act, or are generally outside the scope of the Administrator's authority, and are, therefore, ultra viresunauthorized; beyond the scope of power allowed or granted by a corporate charter or by law. Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). This provision of the current regulation purports to describe how OJJDP may use funds that were originally allocated to a state that is subsequently determined to be ineligible for a formula grant award (including because it has not met one or more of the 33 eligibility requirements set forth at section 223(a) of the JJDP Act), or has chosen not to submit an application for a formula grant award. Section 223(d) of the JJDP Act, however, requires that OJJDP must endeavor to make that State's allocation [excluding the allocation for the state advisory group authorized under 34 U.S.C. 11133(a)(3)] available to local public and private nonprofit agencies within the state and goes on to provide that, if the Administrator is unable to make such an award, the funds must be made available on an equitable basis and to those States that have achieved full compliance with the core requirements. (Emphasis added.) Thus, by the express terms of this statutory provision, those funds may not be reallocated to states that were determined to be out of compliance. The third sentence of section 31.301(e) states that, upon a request for extension, which demonstrates compelling circumstances OJJDP may reallocate the formula grant funds back to the State for which the funds were initially allocated, and thus purports to provide something manifestly contrary to the plain language of section 223(d) of the JJDP Act (34 U.S.C. 11133(d)). Section 31.301(e) is, therefore, ultra vires and must be removed. Section 31.303(f)(1)(i)(A) purports to require that a state identify in its monitoring universe all residential facilities which might hold juveniles pursuant to public authority. The word residential is deleted because, section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act (34 U.S.C. 11133 (a)(14)) requires that States monitor all jails, lock-ups, detention facilities, and correctional facilities, and, plainly, is not limited in scope to residential facilities. Accordingly, the language in this paragraph that purports to limit the reach of the statutory requirement is ultra vires. Consequently, section 31.303(f)(1)(i)(A) must be amended accordingly. Among other things, section 223(a)(11)(A)(ii) of the JJDP Act provides that a juvenile shall not be placed in a secure detention facility or a secure correctional facility if the juvenile is (in common parlance) a non-offender who is an alien[] or is alleged to be dependent, neglected, or abused. A non-offender, pursuant to 28 CFR 31.304(i), is a juvenile who is subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court . . . for reasons other than legally prohibited conduct of the juvenile (emphasis added); and violation of a valid court order is, as a matter of law, legally prohibited conduct. Thus, by definition, a juvenile who has violated a valid court order is not, and cannot be, a non-offender. Section 31.303(f)(3)(vii) of the current regulation, however, purports to provide that an erstwhile non-offender . . . cannot [sic] be placed in secure detention or correctional facilities [sic] for violating a valid court order. Consequently, section 31.303(f)(3)(vii) of the current regulation, which purports to extend section 223(a)(11)(A)(ii) of the JJDP Act (which relates only to non-offenders) to juveniles who are not non-offenders is ultra vires and must be removed. Several amendments to the Formula Grants Program regulation reflect an editorial reclassification of the United States Code, implemented on September 1, 2017, that reorganized certain existing provisions of the United States Code from title 42 into a new title 34. Additionally, other citations in the current regulation are being updated to reflect sections of the JJDP Act that were re-numbered following the 2002 amendments. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) applies to rules that are subject to notice and comment under section 553(b) of the APA. As noted in the discussion, below, regarding the applicability of the APA, this rule is exempt from the 553(b) notice and comment requirements. Consequently, the RFA does not apply. Nevertheless, consistent with the analysis typically required by the Start Printed Page 31154Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has reviewed this regulation and, by approving it, certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Formula Grants Program provides funding to States pursuant to a statutory provision, which is not affected by this regulation. Because States have complete discretion as to which local governments and other entities will receive formula grant funds through subgrants, as well as the amount of any subgrants, this rule will have no direct effect on any particular local governments or entities. This final rule was developed in accordance with the principles of E.O. 12866 and 13563. E.O. 12866, section 1(b), 58 FR 51, 735 (Sept. 30, 1993), which direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health, and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). E.O. 13563 is supplemental to and reaffirms the principles, structures, and definitions governing regulatory review as established in E.O. 12866. OJP has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order No. 12866. As set forth above, this final rule will not have the economic effects described in E.O. 12866, sec. 3(f) (e.g., annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more). It will not create any serious inconsistency or otherwise interference with an action taken or planned by another agency because this rule merely updates an OJJDP program rule. It does not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof because it merely updates the program rule to conform to existing statutory law and makes technical corrections. For the same reasons, it does not raise novel legal or policy issues. Consequently, in accordance with the general principles of Executive Order No. 12866, the Office of Management and Budget has declined review. This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866, and it does not impose a cost greater than zero. This rule issued by the Office of Justice Programs changes the regulations for the OJJDP Formula Grant Program, and thus concerns matters relating to grants, benefits, or contracts, 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). This rule is therefore exempt from the requirement of notice and comment and a 30-day delay in the effective date. Moreover, the purpose of this final rule is (a) to remove provisions of the current regulation that are contrary to the statute upon which they purport to have been predicated when originally promulgated, or that merely parrot or repeat language in the JJDP Act or the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968; and (b) to make technical corrections. Public comments on this final rule would have no effect on the legal necessity of removing the regulatory provisions that are contrary to statute, no effect on the legal redundancy of the parroting or repeating language, and no effect on the making of technical corrections. Finally, the rule would not adversely affect any segment of the public whatsoever, as it does not impose any burdens or requirements on any entities, including Formula Grants Program recipients, and therefore advance notice and public comment are unnecessary. In addition, these rule amendments remove provisions of the regulation that were rendered null and void by subsequent amendments to the JJDP Act, (which repealed the predicate statutory provisions upon which the regulatory provisions were based), and parroting regulations that unnecessarily repeat other provisions of law, and otherwise make only technical corrections to U.S. Code citations in cross-references. Where provisions of the regulation are predicated on defunct or amended statutory provisions, it causes confusion as to the requirements that Formula Grants Program grantees must meet. For these reasons, it is contrary to the public interest to delay implementation of this rule. The Formula Grants Program does not impose any mandates on States; nor does it interfere with States' sovereignty, authorities, or rights. States, rather, participate in the Program voluntarily and, as a condition of receipt of funding to improve their juvenile justice systems and to operate juvenile delinquency prevention programs, agree to comply with the Program's requirements. This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. The rule will not impose substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments, or preempt any State laws. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order No. 13132, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This rule meets the applicable standards set forth in sections 3(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12988. Pursuant to section 3(b)(1)(I) of the Executive Order, nothing in this or any previous rule (or in any administrative policy, directive, ruling, notice, guideline, guidance, or writing) directly relating to the Program that is the subject of this rule is intended to create any legal or procedural rights enforceable against the United States, except as the same may be contained within subpart A of part 31 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more in any one year, and it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. The Formula Grants Program provides funds to States to improve their juvenile justice systems and to support juvenile delinquency prevention programs. As a condition of funding, States agree to comply with the Formula Grants Program requirements. Therefore, no actions are necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. This rule is not a major rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804. This rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign-based companies in domestic and export markets. This rule does not propose any new, or changes to existing, collection[s] of information as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 Start Printed Page 31155U.S.C. 3501, et seq.) and its implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. Table of Amendments to OJJDP Formula Grants Program Regulation28 CFR Part 31 Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, part 31 of chapter I of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: 1. The general authority citation for part 31 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C 5611(b); 42 U.S.C. 5631-5633. 2. Subpart A is revised to read as follows: Authority: 34 U.S.C. 11111(b); 34 U.S.C. 11131. (a) This implements subpart I of part B of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, which authorizes a formula grant program. (b) In addition to this subpart, other rules or regulations may be applicable to the formula grant program described in paragraph (a) of this section; see, e.g., 2 CFR part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards), as adopted by the Department of Justice through 2 CFR part 2800 or other applicable regulation; and 28 CFR part 42 (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted ProgramsImplementation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). (c) Unless expressly provided otherwise, any reference in this subpart to any provision of Federal law not in this subpart shall be understood to constitute a general reference and thus to include any subsequent amendments to the provision. The Statute establishing the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and giving authority to make grants for juvenile justice and delinquency prevention improvement programs is the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (34 U.S.C. 11101 et seq.) The State advisory group established pursuant to section 223(a)(3) will follow applicable State open meeting and public access laws and regulations in the conduct of meetings and the maintenance of records relating to their functions. (a) [Reserved] (b) Funds for local use. At least two-thirds of the formula grant allocation to the state (other than the section 222(d) State Advisory Group set aside) must be used for programs by local government, local private agencies, and eligible Indian tribes, unless the State applies for and is granted a waiver by the OJJDP. The proportion of pass-through funds to be made available to eligible Indian tribes shall be based upon that proportion of the state youth population under 18 years of age who reside in geographical areas where the tribes perform law enforcement functions. (1) [Reserved] (2) [Reserved] (3) To carry out this requirement, OJJDP will annually provide each state with the most recent Bureau of Census statistics on the number of persons under age 18 living within the state, and the number of persons under age 18 who reside in geographical areas where Indian tribes perform law enforcement functions. (4) Pass-through funds available to tribal entities under section 223(a)(5)(C) shall be made available within states to Indian tribes, combinations of Indian tribes, or to an organization or organizations designated by such tribe(s). Where the relative number of persons under age 18 within a geographic area where an Indian tribe performs law enforcement functions is too small to warrant an individual subgrant or subgrants, the state may, after consultation with the eligible tribe(s), make pass-through funds available to a combination of eligible tribes within the state, or to an organization or organizations designated by and representing a group of qualifying tribes, or target the funds on the larger tribal jurisdictions within the state. (5) [Reserved] (c) [Reserved] (d) [Reserved] (e) Nonparticipating States. Formula grant funds allocated to a State which has failed to submit an application, plan, or monitoring data establishing its eligibility for the funds will be reallocated to the nonparticipating State program on September 30 of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated. Reallocated funds will be competitively awarded to eligible recipients pursuant to program announcements. (a) [Reserved] (b) Advisory group. Pursuant to section 223(a)(3) of the JJDP Act, the State shall provide a list of all current advisory group members, indicating their respective dates of appointment and how each member meets the membership requirements specified in this section of the Act. (c) [Reserved] (a) [Reserved] (b) [Reserved] (c) Deinstitutionalization of status offenders and non-offenders (DSO). Pursuant to section 223(a) (11) of the JJDP Act, the State shall: (1) Describe its plan, procedure, and timetable covering the three-year planning cycle, for assuring that the requirements of this section are met. Refer to paragraph (f)(3) of this section for the rules related to the valid court order exception to this Act requirement. (2) Describe the barriers the State faces in achieving full compliance with the provisions of this requirement. (3) Apply this requirement to alien juveniles under Federal jurisdiction who are held in State or local facilities. (4) Those States which, based upon the most recently submitted monitoring report, have been found to be in full compliance with section 223(a)(11) may, in lieu of addressing paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, provide an assurance that adequate plans and resources are available to maintain full compliance. (5) [Reserved] (d) Separation. (1) Pursuant to section 223(a)(12) of the JJDP Act the State shall: (i) Describe its plan and procedure, covering the three-year planning cycle, for assuring that the requirements of this section are met. Separation must be accomplished architecturally or through policies and procedures in all secure areas of the facility which include, but are not limited to, such areas as admissions, sleeping, and shower and toilet areas. Brief and inadvertent sight or sound contact between juveniles alleged to be or found to be delinquent or those within the purview of 34 U.S.C. 11133(a)(11)(A) and adult inmates in secure areas of a facility that are not dedicated to use by juveniles and which are nonresidential, which may include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, sally ports or other entry areas, and passageways (hallways), would not require a facility or the State to document or report such contact as a violation. However, any contact in a dedicated juvenile area, Start Printed Page 31162including any residential area of a secure facility, between juveniles in a secure custody status and adult inmates would be a reportable violation. (ii) In those instances where accused juvenile criminal-type offenders are authorized to be temporarily detained in facilities where adults are confined, the State must set forth the procedures for assuring no sight or sound contact between such juveniles and adult inmates. (iii) Describe the barriers which may hinder the separation of alleged or adjudicated criminal type offenders, status offenders and non-offenders from adult inmates in any particular jail, lockup, detention or correctional facility. (iv) Those States which, based upon the most recently submitted monitoring report, have been found to be in compliance with section 223(a)(12) may, in lieu of addressing paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, provide an assurance that adequate plans and resources are available to maintain compliance. (v) Assure that adjudicated delinquents are not reclassified administratively and transferred to an adult (criminal) correctional authority to avoid the intent of separating juveniles from adult criminals in jails or correctional facilities. A State is not prohibited from placing or transferring an alleged or adjudicated delinquent who reaches the State's age of full criminal responsibility to an adult facility when required or authorized by State law. However, the administrative transfer, without statutory direction or authorization, of a juvenile offender to an adult correctional authority, or a transfer within a mixed juvenile and adult facility for placement with adult criminals, either before or after a juvenile reaches the age of full criminal responsibility, is prohibited. A State is also precluded from transferring adult offenders to a juvenile correctional authority for placement in a juvenile facility. This neither prohibits nor restricts the waiver or transfer of a juvenile to criminal court for prosecution, in accordance with State law, for a criminal felony violation, nor the detention or confinement of a waived or transferred criminal felony violator in an adult facility. (2) [Reserved] (e) Removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups. Pursuant to section 223(a)(13) of the JJDP Act, the State shall: (1) Describe its plan, procedure, and timetable for assuring that requirements of this section will be met. (2) Describe the barriers that a State faces in removing all juveniles from adult jails and lockups, except as provided in section 223(a)(13). (3)(i) Determine whether or not a facility in which juveniles are detained or confined is an adult jail or lockup. The JJDP Act prohibits the detention of juveniles in adult jails and lockups, except as otherwise provided under the Act and implementing OJJDP regulations. Juvenile facilities collocated with adult facilities are considered adult jails or lockups absent compliance with criteria established in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(C)(1), (2), and (4) of this section. (A) A collocated facility is a juvenile facility located in the same building as an adult jail or lockup, or is part of a related complex of buildings located on the same grounds as an adult jail or lockup. A complex of buildings is considered related when it shares physical features such as walls and fences, or services beyond mechanical services (heating, air conditioning, water and sewer). (B) The State must determine whether a collocated facility qualifies as a separate juvenile detention facility under the criteria set forth in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(C)(1), (2), and (4) of this section for the purpose of monitoring compliance with section 223(a)(12)(A), (13) and (14) of the JJDP Act. (C) Each of the following criteria must be met in order to ensure the requisite separateness of a juvenile detention facility that is collocated with an adult jail or lockup: (1) Separation between juveniles and adult inmates such that there could be no sustained sight or sound contact between juveniles and adult inmates in the facility. Separation can be achieved architecturally or through time-phasing of common use nonresidential areas; and (2) Separate juvenile and adult programs, including recreation, education, vocation, counseling, dining, sleeping, and general living activities. There must be an independent and comprehensive operational plan for the juvenile detention facility which provides for a full range of separate program services. No program activities may be shared by juveniles and adult inmates. Time-phasing of common use nonresidential areas is permissible to conduct program activities. Equipment and other resources may be used by both populations subject to security concerns; and (3) [Reserved.] (4) In States that have established standards or licensing requirements for juvenile detention facilities, the juvenile facility must meet the standards (on the same basis as a free-standing juvenile detention center) and be licensed as appropriate. If there are no State standards or licensing requirements, OJJDP encourages States to establish administrative requirements that authorize the State to review the facility's physical plant, staffing patterns, and programs in order to approve the collocated facility based on prevailing national juvenile detention standards. (ii) The State must determine that all of the criteria are fully met. It is incumbent upon the State to make the determination through an on-site facility (or full construction and operations plan) review and, through the exercise of its oversight responsibility, to ensure that the separate character of the juvenile detention facility is maintained by continuing to fully meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(C)(1), (2), and (4) of this section. (iii) [Reserved] (iv) An annual on-site review of the facility must be conducted by the compliance monitoring staff person(s) representing or employed by the State agency administering the JJDP Act Formula Grants Program. The purpose of the annual review is to determine if compliance with the criteria set forth in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(C)(1), (2), and (4) of this section is being maintained. (4) Those States which, based upon the most recently submitted monitoring report, have been found to be in full compliance with section 223(a)(13) may, in lieu of addressing paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, provide an assurance that adequate plans and resources are available to maintain full compliance. (f) Monitoring of jails, detention facilities and correctional facilities. (1) Elements of a compliance monitoring system. Pursuant to section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act, and except as provided by paragraph (f)(7) of this section, the State shall: (i) Describe its plan, procedure, and timetable for annually monitoring jails, lockups, detention facilities, and correctional facilities. The plan must at a minimum describe in detail each of the following tasks including the identification of the specific agency(s) responsible for each task. (A) Identification of monitoring universe: This refers to the identification of all facilities which might hold juveniles pursuant to public authority and thus must be classified to determine if it should be included in the monitoring effort. This includes those facilities owned or operated by public and private agencies.Start Printed Page 31163 (B) Classification of the monitoring universe: This is the classification of all facilities to determine which ones should be considered as a secure detention or correctional facility, adult correctional institution, jail, lockup, or other type of secure facility. (C) Inspection of facilities: Inspection of facilities is necessary to ensure an accurate assessment of each facility's classification and record keeping. The inspection must include: (1) A review of the physical accommodations to determine whether it is a secure or non-secure facility or whether adequate sight and sound separation between juvenile and adult offenders exists and (2) A review of the record keeping system to determine whether sufficient data are maintained to determine compliance with section 223(a)(11), (12) and/or (13). (D) Data collection and data verification: This is the actual collection and reporting of data to determine whether the facility is in compliance with the applicable requirement(s) of section 223(a)(11), (12) and/or (13). The length of the reporting period should be 12 months of data. If the data is self-reported by the facility or is collected and reported by an agency other than the State agency designated pursuant to section 223(a)(1) of the JJDP Act, the plan must describe a statistically valid procedure used to verify the reported data. (ii) Provide a description of the barriers which the State faces in implementing and maintaining a monitoring system to report the level of compliance with section 223(a)(11), (12), and (13) and how it plans to overcome such barriers.

Proposed rule, request for comment. The Board is proposing amendments to Regulation J to govern funds transfers through the Federal Reserve Banks' (Reserve Banks) new FedNowSM Service by establishing a new subpart C. The Board is also proposing changes and clarifications to subpart B, governing the Fedwire Funds Service, to reflect the fact that the Reserve Banks will be operating a second funds transfer service in addition to the Fedwire Funds Service, as well as proposing technical corrections to subpart A, governing the check service. Comments must be submitted by August 10, 2021.

Instant payment services have emerged globally over the past two decades to address the enhanced speed and convenience expected by the public for payment transactions in modern digital economies. Instant payments allow individuals and businesses to send and receive payments at any time of the day, on any day of the year, and to complete those payments within seconds (from the end user perspective) such that the beneficiary has access immediately to final funds, meaning funds they can use at that time. Beyond speed and convenience, instant payments can yield real economic benefits for individuals and businesses by providing them with more flexibility to manage their money and allowing them to make time-sensitive payments whenever needed. In light of these potential benefits, there is broad consensus within the U.S. payment community that, just as real-time services have become standard for other everyday activities, instant payment services have the potential to become widely used, resulting in a significant and positive impact on the U.S. economy. In 2019, the Board issued a Federal Register notice announcing that the Reserve Banks would develop a new interbank 24x7x365 real-time gross settlement service with integrated clearing functionality, called the FedNow Service, to support instant payments in the United States (the 2019 Notice). The Board's determination was based on the public benefits that the service would provide and the Board's assessment that such a service would meet the requirements of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, as well as the Board's criteria for new or enhanced Federal Reserve payment services.[1] The FedNow Service will operate alongside similar services provided by the private sector to provide core infrastructure supporting instant payments in the United States. In the 2019 Notice, the Board also requested comment on all aspects of the planned service. One proposed aspect was that banks would be required to make funds associated with individual instant payments available to their end-user customers immediately after receiving notification from the service that an instant payment had settled. In August 2020, the Board issued a subsequent Federal Register notice describing the FedNow Service details (the 2020 Notice), based on additional analysis informed by the comments received in response to the 2019 Notice.[2] In that notice, the Board approved, among other things, the aspect of immediate funds availability proposed in the 2019 Notice. The Board also indicated that it was assessing applicable laws and regulations, and, to the extent changes to the Board's regulations were needed, including to clarify funds availability, the Board would request public comment. The Board has completed its assessment with respect to Regulation J and is issuing this request for comment on the regulation incorporating changes to provide a legal framework for the FedNow Service. The Board's proposed amendments to Regulation J establish a new subpart C to govern funds transfers made through the FedNow Service and amend the title of the regulation. The Board is also proposing technical changes and clarifications to subpart B, which governs funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service, to reflect the fact that the Reserve Banks will be operating two funds transfer services. The Board is further proposing technical corrections to subpart A of the regulation, which governs the collection of checks and other items by the Reserve Banks. Subpart B of Regulation J currently specifies the rules applicable to funds transfers handled by Reserve Banks over the Fedwire Funds Service. Subpart B would not apply to transfers over the new FedNow Service, which will be a separate funds transfer service operated by the Reserve Banks. The Board is proposing a new subpart C of Regulation J to provide a comprehensive set of rules governing funds transfers over the FedNow Service. As it did for subpart B, the Board proposes to adopt a commentary to subpart C that would constitute a Board interpretation of the regulation. In general, the proposed new subpart C of Regulation J specifies the terms and conditions under which Reserve Banks Start Printed Page 31377will process funds transfers over the FedNow Service, as well as grants the Reserve Banks authority to issue an operating circular for the FedNow Service, which would detail more specific terms and conditions governing the FedNow Service consistent with the proposed subpart. Additionally, proposed subpart C's terms of service include a requirement for a FedNow participant that is the beneficiary's bank to make funds available to the beneficiary immediately after it has accepted the payment order over the service. Proposed new subpart C also expands and clarifies the applicability of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 4A to all transfers over the FedNow Service, subject to a limited number of modifications and clarifications that are consistent with the purposes of UCC Article 4A. UCC Article 4A, which has been adopted in all 50 states, provides comprehensive rules governing the rights and responsibilities of the parties to funds transfers. The rights and responsibilities covered in UCC Article 4A include those with respect to the receipt, acceptance or rejection, and execution of a payment order and settlement of a payment obligation; liability for the late, erroneous, or improper execution of funds transfers; the risks of loss associated with an unauthorized payment order; the obligation to pay for and the right to receive payment for a payment order; and the effect of payment by funds transfer on any underlying obligation between an originator and a beneficiary of a funds transfer. The Board incorporated UCC Article 4A, as approved by the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1989, into Regulation J for purposes of the Fedwire Funds Service and proposes to do the same for the FedNow Service. The Board believes that this incorporation is necessary to ensure that the law applicable to all transfers over the FedNow Service is consistent, predictable, and clear. The Board also proposes to replace the currently incorporated 1989 version of UCC Article 4A with the more recent 2012 version and to set forth those provisions in Appendix A of part 210, rather than in Appendix B of subpart B where they are currently set forth.[3] Other minor changes are also proposed to Regulation J to make clarifying amendments to subpart B and technical corrections in subpart A. The Board does not believe that the proposed amendments to subparts A and B would impose additional operating burdens on any parties. The Board requests comment on all aspects of the proposed amendment to Regulation J and the specific questions posed below. The Board is proposing technical corrections in subpart A of Regulation J to update cross-references to other regulations that are no longer current. Additionally, the Board is proposing amendments to subpart B, governing funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service, to reflect the fact that the Reserve Banks will be operating two separate funds transfer systems with the launch of the FedNow Service and distinguish between the two services. For example, the proposed amendments include clarifications to 210.25(b) with respect to subpart B's scope of application and modifications to the definitions of the following terms: Beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, payment order, receiving bank, and sender. These proposed amendments are intended to clarify that the provisions of subpart B are limited to payment orders and parties to a funds transfer that are sent through the Fedwire Funds Service; payment orders and parties to a funds transfer that are sent through the FedNow Service, for example, would not be governed by subpart B. Additionally, the proposed amendments to subpart B include changes to update 210.25(c), which authorizes Reserve Banks to issue operating circulars consistent with the subpart in connection with the Fedwire Funds Service. The proposed revisions explicitly authorize Reserve Banks to issue operating circulars that specify the time and method of receipt, execution, and acceptance of a payment order and settlement of a Reserve Bank's payment obligation for purposes of UCC Article 4A; specify service terms governing ancillary features of the Fedwire Funds Service; and provide for the acceptance of documents in electronic form to the extent any provision in UCC Article 4A requires an agreement or other document to be in writing. The proposed amendments to subpart B further include minor changes to 210.28(b)(3) to provide that the security interest that a sender grants to a Reserve Bank is with respect to all of the sender's assets in the possession of, as well as in the control of, or held for the account of, the Reserve Bank; additional revisions are proposed to the commentary to that section to clarify its description of relevant UCC Article 4A provisions. Additionally, the proposed amendments to subpart B include a minor change to 210.30 to clarify that a sender may not send a payment order to a Reserve Bank that specifies an execution date, nor may it specify a payment date, that is later than the day on which the payment order is issued, unless the Reserve Bank agrees with the sender in writing to follow such instructions. The proposed amendments to subpart B also include a clarifying revision to 210.32, which governs the payment of compensation by Reserve Banks in the form of interest. Section 210.32 provides that, when a Reserve Bank is obligated to pay compensation to another party in connection with its handling of a funds transfer under UCC Article 4A, the Reserve Bank shall pay compensation in the form of interest to its sender, its receiving bank, its beneficiary, or another party to the funds transfer that is entitled to such payment. The proposed revisions refer to these payments as compensation rather than interest payments. The Board believes this clarification would help remove any confusion that such payment is related to any purpose other than compensation, such as monetary policy transmission. Finally, the Board is proposing technical revisions in the commentary to subpart B to correct cross-references to UCC Article 1 and to update cross-references to statutes and other regulations that are no longer current. The Board is proposing to amend Regulation J to establish a new subpart C governing funds transfers over the FedNow Service. Many of the concepts embodied in the proposed subpart C are similar to those currently in subpart B Start Printed Page 31378of Regulation J. Like the Fedwire Funds Service, the FedNow Service is a real-time gross settlement system and a funds-transfer service under UCC Article 4A. However, a number of the proposed subpart C provisions have been tailored to the nature of the FedNow Service where it differs from that of the Fedwire Funds Service. In particular, the FedNow Service is designed for the end-to-end transfer to be completed in a matter of seconds, as described in the 2020 Notice. This means that the beneficiary's bank would agree, as provided in proposed subpart C, that it will make funds available to the beneficiary immediately after it has accepted the payment order. Another difference between the FedNow Service and the Fedwire Funds Service is that the FedNow Service will accommodate participants that choose to settle their activity over the service in the master account of a correspondent bank. In contrast, participants in the Fedwire Funds Service are limited to settling their activity over that service in their own master account. The terms of proposed subpart C reflect the fact that FedNow Service will support this additional mechanism for settling obligations that arise between Reserve Banks and FedNow participants. Further, unlike the Fedwire Funds Service, which is designed to serve primarily as a large-value funds transfer system between institutional users, the FedNow Service is designed to also accommodate consumer use. Therefore, in the event that a transfer over the FedNow Service meets the definition of electronic fund transfer under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), proposed subpart C provides that it would apply to the transfer but the EFTA would prevail to the extent of any inconsistency, as discussed further later. This proposed section summarizes the Board's authority to adopt this regulation and provides a description of how the subpart is organized. Similar to the rules governing the Fedwire Funds Service in subpart B, new subpart C would incorporate those provisions of UCC Article 4A (as set forth in an appendix to Regulation J) into subpart C that are not inconsistent with the provisions set forth expressly in subpart C. Specifically, proposed subpart C provides that UCC Article 4A applies to all funds transfers over the FedNow Service, including a transfer from a consumer originator or a transfer to a consumer beneficiary that is carried out through the FedNow Service. Such a consumer transaction could potentially be subject to the EFTA. By its terms, UCC Article 4A would not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the EFTA. Therefore, absent this proposed section in subpart C, a number of important legal aspects with respect to these consumer transfers over the FedNow Service could potentially lack clear and consistent rules. This proposed section provides that all transfers over the FedNow Service, including those transfers any portion of which is governed by the EFTA, are covered by subpart C (which incorporates UCC Article 4A by reference); however, in the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of subpart C and the EFTA, the proposed section provides that the EFTA would prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. The commentary accompanying this proposed provision in subpart C provides an illustrative example. The Board believes this proposed provision is necessary in order to provide a clear, consistent, and comprehensive set of rules for all funds transfers over the FedNow Service, consistent with the EFTA and the purposes of UCC Article 4A. This proposed section also specifies the parties subject to proposed subpart C with respect to the FedNow Service. These parties would include senders that send payment orders to a Reserve Bank over the service, receiving banks that receive payment orders from a Reserve Bank over the service, beneficiaries that receive payment for payment orders by means of a credit to their settlement account with a Reserve Bank, and Reserve Banks that send or receive payment orders over the FedNow Service. For example, suppose that Payor has an account with Bank A and instructs Bank A to pay $1,000 to Payee's account at Bank B, and Bank A carries out Payor's instruction using the FedNow Service.[4] Suppose further that Bank A and Bank B maintain accounts on the books of different Reserve Banks. In this example, the Reserve Bank of Bank A and the Reserve Bank of Bank B would be intermediary banks; Bank A would be the sender with respect to the payment order that it sends to its Reserve Bank; Bank B would be the receiving bank with respect to the payment order that it receives from its Reserve Bank. In this example, the Reserve Banks of Bank A and Bank B would be subject to proposed subpart C, because they are Reserve Banks sending or receiving payment orders over the FedNow Service. It is possible that a Reserve Bank may also be subject to subpart C in its capacity as a beneficiary's bank with respect to a payment order (e.g., interbank credit transfers between FedNow participants). For other capacities, however, a Reserve Bank would not be a party to the funds transfer for purposes of proposed subpart C and UCC Article 4A. For example, if a sender settles its activity over the FedNow Service in the account of a correspondent bank, the sender's Reserve Bank would be an intermediary bank in the funds transfer chain, but the Reserve Bank of the correspondent bank would not be a sender or receiving bank with respect to the payment order and would not be a party to the funds transfer. Under the proposed section, subpart C would also apply to any party to a funds transfer sent through the FedNow Service that is in privity (i.e., has a contractual relationship) with a Reserve Bank in the funds transfer chain. Other parties to a funds transfer sent through the FedNow Service (i.e., a party not in privity with a Reserve Bank, such as Payor and Payee in the example above) would be covered by this proposed subpart only under certain circumstances. If these remote parties have notice that the FedNow Service might be used for their funds transfer and that subpart C is the governing law with respect to the transfer over the FedNow Service, then proposed subpart C would govern their rights and obligations with respect to the FedNow Service. However, it is possible for that remote party to expressly select by agreement a governing law other than subpart C with respect to its rights and obligations in connection with that transfer. For example, Payor and Bank A in the example above could make an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction, and not subpart C, to govern rights and obligations between each other. In that event, the law of that jurisdiction would govern those rights and obligations, and not subpart C, even if the remote party (Payor) had notice that the FedNow Service may be used and that subpart C is the governing law with respect to the transfer over the FedNow Service. Finally, this proposed section authorizes Reserve Banks to issue operating circulars which would detail more specific terms and conditions governing the FedNow Service consistent with the proposed subpart. Start Printed Page 31379Similar to the rules governing the Fedwire Funds Service in subpart B and the proposed clarifying edits to subpart B, new subpart C would authorize the Reserve Banks to issue operating circulars with respect to the FedNow Service that may set cut-off hours and funds-transfer business days; address security procedures offered by the Reserve Banks to verify the authenticity of a payment order; specify format and media requirements for payment orders; identify messages that are not payment orders; specify the time and method of receipt, execution, and acceptance of a payment order and settlement of a Reserve Bank's payment obligation for purposes of UCC Article 4A; specify service terms governing ancillary features of the FedNow Service; provide for the acceptance of documents in electronic form to the extent any provision in UCC Article 4A requires an agreement or other document to be in writing; and impose charges for funds transfer services. Reflecting aspects where the FedNow Service differs from the Fedwire Funds Service, the proposed section further provides that Reserve Bank operating circulars governing the FedNow Service may also prescribe time limits for the processing of payment orders. This proposed section defines the terms used in the regulation. Similar to subpart B, proposed subpart C generally incorporates the definitions set forth in UCC Article 4A (e.g., beneficiary, intermediary bank, receiving bank, and security procedure), in some instances with modifications. Specifically, the proposed subpart modifies the definitions of five UCC Article 4A terms: Beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, payment order, receiving bank, and sender. In general, these modifications are intended to clarify that, for the purposes of subpart C, these terms would be limited to payment orders and parties in a funds transfer that are sent through the FedNow Service. Parties to a funds transfer that is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service, for example, would not be a beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, receiving bank, or sender as those terms are defined in proposed subpart C. This proposed section also includes definitions of other terms not defined in UCC Article 4A, including sender's settlement account, receiving bank's settlement account, and beneficiary's settlement account. These terms reflect the fact that a FedNow participant may settle its activity over the FedNow Service in either its master account with a Reserve Bank or, alternatively, the master account of a correspondent bank with a Reserve Bank. Whether it is its own master account or that of a correspondent, a FedNow participant would need to designate a settlement account on the books of a Reserve Bank that the Reserve Banks may use to settle the participant's activity over the FedNow Service. This proposed section also includes a definition of the term Federal Reserve Bank with respect to an entity, which is not a term defined in UCC Article 4A. In instances where a FedNow participant maintains an account with a Reserve Bank, this proposed section takes an approach similar to the rules governing the Fedwire Funds Service in subpart B. In those instances, the term Federal Reserve Bank with respect to the FedNow participant means the Reserve Bank at which the participant maintains an account. To reflect the fact that the FedNow Service will also accommodate participants that choose to settle their activity over the service in the master account of a correspondent bank, the proposed definition also addresses instances where a FedNow participant does not maintain a master account with a Reserve Bank. In those instances, the term Federal Reserve Bank with respect to that participant means the Reserve Bank in whose District the participant is located, as determined under the procedure described in Part 204 of this chapter (Regulation D), even if the participant is not otherwise subject to that section. As noted above, the Reserve Bank of the participant would be a party to the funds transfer, but the Reserve Bank of its correspondent bank would not be a party to the funds transfer. This proposed section provides that a Reserve Bank may rely on the number in the payment order identifying the beneficiary's bank or the beneficiary, consistent with UCC Article 4A. As a practical matter, reliance on identifying numbers enables banks to more efficiently process payment orders by automated means. Rather than manual processing of payment orders with human reading of the contents of the order, banks typically use machines to read orders that, using a standard format, identify the beneficiary's bank by routing number or the beneficiary by the number of a bank account, or by other identifying number. This standard format might also allow for the inclusion of additional information in the payment order (e.g., the name of the beneficiary's bank or the beneficiary) that can be useful for reference, even if not relied upon to process the payment order. If a payment order contains both the identifying number and the name of the beneficiary's bank or beneficiary supplied by the originator of the funds transfer, it might be possible for a receiving bank processing the order to detect an inconsistency and determine that the name and number do not refer to the same party. UCC Article 4A provides that a bank is under no duty to make such a determination that the identifying number and name refer to the same party in processing the payment order. If such a duty were imposed, the benefits of automated payments would be significantly lost; these benefits include the substantial economies of operation and the reduction in the possibility of clerical error. Rather, UCC Article 4A allows receiving banks to act on the basis of the identifying number, without regard to name provided in the payment order, so long as the bank does not know the name and number refer to different parties. Consistent with UCC Article 4A, proposed 210.42 provides that a Reserve Bank, as receiving bank, may rely on the routing number of the beneficiary's bank specified in a payment order as identifying the appropriate beneficiary's bank, even if the payment order identifies another bank by name, provided that the Reserve Bank does not know of the inconsistency. Similarly, a Reserve Bank, where it acts as the beneficiary's bank, may rely on the number identifying a beneficiary, such as the beneficiary's account number, specified in a payment order as identifying the appropriate beneficiary, even if the payment order identifies another beneficiary by name, provided that the Reserve Bank does not know of the inconsistency. The proposed section also serves to provide notice to nonbank senders that send payment orders directly to a Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service that the Reserve Bank may rely on the numbers in the payment orders identifying the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary. Proposed 210.43 describes when an obligation to pay arises for FedNow participants that send a payment order over the FedNow Service and how that obligation is discharged. Under that proposed section, when a sender sends a payment order to a Reserve Bank over the FedNow Service and the Reserve Bank accepts the payment order, the sender has an obligation to pay the Start Printed Page 31380Reserve Bank for the amount of the payment order. This proposed section further specifies that the obligation of the sender is paid by a debit to the settlement account of the sender. This approach is generally similar to that taken by subpart B for the Fedwire Funds Service, but it has been adjusted to reflect the fact that the FedNow Service will accommodate participants that choose to settle their activity over the service in the master account of a correspondent bank. The proposed section, therefore, provides that the sender authorizes its Reserve Bank to obtain payment for a payment order by debiting, or causing another Reserve Bank (i.e., the Reserve Bank of the correspondent bank, if one is used) to debit, the amount of the payment order from the settlement account. In addition, this proposed section includes provisions addressing overdrafts, taking an approach similar to that of subpart B, with adjustments to reflect the fact that the participant activity over the FedNow Service will settle in settlement accounts designated by the FedNow participant. The proposed section establishes that a sender does not have a right to an overdraft in its settlement account and sets out the sender's obligations to ensure there are sufficient funds in its settlement account and to cover any overdraft by the time the overdraft becomes due and payable. This section also provides a Reserve Bank with a security interest in the sender's assets held at any Reserve Bank to secure any obligation owed and also specifies the actions a Reserve Bank may take to recover the amount of an overdraft, including set-off and realization of collateral. Finally, this proposed section clarifies that settlement accounts could be subject to overdraft charges, where applicable. With respect to FedNow participants that receive payment orders over the service and accept the order, 210.44 specifies how the participant receives payment. The proposed section provides that for payment orders that a receiving bank receives from a Reserve Bank over the FedNow Service, payment for the order is made by credit to the settlement account of the receiving bank. This approach is generally similar to that taken by the rules governing the Fedwire Funds Service in subpart B, with adjustments to reflect the fact that the FedNow Service will accommodate settlement in a participant's own master account or, if the participant chooses, the master account of a correspondent bank. Specifically, the proposed section provides that the receiving bank authorizes its Reserve Bank to pay for the payment order by crediting, or causing another Reserve Bank (i.e., the Reserve Bank of the correspondent bank, if one is used), to credit the amount of the payment order to the settlement account. The proposed section also includes a requirement for a FedNow participant that is the beneficiary's bank to make funds available to the beneficiary immediately after its acceptance of the payment order over the service. As noted above, this requirement reflects the fact that an end-to-end transfer over the FedNow Service is intended to be completed in a matter of seconds. Under the proposed section, if a FedNow participant accepts a payment order over the service, it must pay the beneficiary by crediting the beneficiary's account, and it must do so immediately after its acceptance of the payment order. The Board specifically requests comment on whether the regulation should set out specific time parameters to clarify the meaning of immediately as used in this funds availability requirement and, if so, whether a timeframe of within seconds or, alternatively, within one minute after the bank has accepted the payment order would be reasonable. Relatedly, the proposed section states that the rights and obligations with respect to the availability of funds are also governed by the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation CC. Regulation CC provides that funds received by a bank by an electronic payment shall be available for withdrawal not later than the business day after the banking day on which such funds are received. The proposed new subpart C would require funds to be made available on a more prompt basis than the availability requirements of the EFAA and Regulation CC. Proposed 210.44 therefore clarifies that the EFAA and Regulation CC requirements continue to apply independently of subpart C. The proposed commentary provides an example where a beneficiary's bank has failed to satisfy the immediate funds availability requirement under proposed subpart C, even if it has satisfied its obligations under Regulation CC. The proposed section also clarifies that the obligation for the beneficiary's bank to provide immediate funds availability to the beneficiary does not affect any liability of the beneficiary's bank to the beneficiary, or any party other than a Reserve Bank, under UCC Article 4A or other law. The Board believes that the bank-customer relationship should be governed by existing law, rather than the funds availability timing requirement that would apply to a FedNow participant as a term of the service. The proposed commentary explains that the timing requirement in this section does not create any new rights that the beneficiary may assert against the beneficiary's bank or otherwise alter any rights of the beneficiary under UCC Article 4A or other applicable law. Finally, the proposed section addresses certain circumstances in which a FedNow participant that is the beneficiary's bank requires additional time to determine whether to accept the payment order because it has reasonable cause to believe that the beneficiary is not entitled or permitted to receive payment. In those circumstances, if the FedNow participant notifies its Reserve Bank that it requires additional time, the FedNow participant would not be deemed to have accepted the payment order at such time as would otherwise be considered acceptance of the payment under proposed subpart C (i.e., when it receives payment from its Reserve Bank). The proposed commentary provides an example of when this provision might apply: When the beneficiary's bank has reasonable cause to believe that making funds available to the beneficiary may violate applicable U.S. sanctions. The Board specifically requests comment on whether this proposed section is sufficient to cover the likely range of circumstances where a FedNow participant may need additional time to determine whether to accept a payment order. This proposed section sets forth the terms under which a Reserve Bank will accept payment orders from a sender over the FedNow Service. Similar to the rules governing the Fedwire Funds Service in subpart B, this proposed section provides that a sender must make arrangements with its Reserve Bank before it may send payment orders over the FedNow Service. Also similar to subpart B, this proposed section provides that a Reserve Bank may reject any payment order or impose conditions on the acceptance of payment orders over the FedNow Service for any reason. The proposed commentary provides examples of when rejections might occur with respect to insufficient funds in the sender's settlement account and the lack of a required agreement concerning security procedures, which Start Printed Page 31381mirror the commentary examples in subpart B. The proposed commentary also includes a further example of when a rejection may occur: When a payment order is not successfully processed within time limits established by the Reserve Banks, which reflects the fact that the FedNow Service is designed for the end-to-end transfer to be completed in a matter of seconds. This proposed section also provides terms with respect to the selection of an intermediary bank for a transfer over the FedNow Service. It takes a similar approach to that of subpart B with respect to the Fedwire Funds Service, with adjustments to reflect that the fact that for the FedNow Service, the Reserve Banks will be the only intermediary banks in the funds transfer chain. Reflecting this transaction structure for transfers over the FedNow Service, the proposed section provides that a FedNow participant may not send a payment order to a Reserve Bank that requires the Reserve Bank to issue a payment order to an intermediary bank other than another Reserve Bank. This proposed section also provides that a sender may not send a value-dated payment order through the FedNow Service, unless the Reserve Bank agrees with the sender in writing to follow such instructions. This proposed section addresses the timing of when a Reserve Bank makes payment to a receiving bank (when the Reserve Bank is an intermediary bank) or beneficiary (when the Reserve Bank is the beneficiary's bank). It adopts a similar approach as that taken by subpart B for the Fedwire Funds Service, but it has been adjusted to reflect the fact that the FedNow Service will also accommodate participants that choose to settle their activity over the service in the master account of a correspondent bank. The proposed section, therefore, provides that payment to a FedNow participant by Reserve Banks is final at the earlier of the time when the amount of the payment order is credited to the FedNow participant's settlement account (which may be the participant's own master account or the master account of its correspondent bank), or the time when the Reserve Bank sends to the FedNow participant either a conforming payment order or, in instances where the FedNow participant is the beneficiary, a notice of the credit. This payment would be final and irrevocable when made.[5] This proposed section addresses liability of the Reserve Banks, similar to the rules governing the Fedwire Funds Service in subpart B. It provides that, in connection with its handling of a payment order, a Reserve Bank shall not agree to be liable to a sender, receiving bank, beneficiary, or other Reserve Bank for consequential damages resulting from the Reserve Bank's failure to execute a payment order. This proposed section is consistent with the presumption in UCC Article 4A, under which damages for a receiving bank's failure to execute a payment order that it was obligated to execute by express agreement do not include consequential damages, unless they are provided for in an express written agreement of the receiving bank. This proposed section is not intended to affect the liability of parties more broadly. For example, it is not intended to affect the ability of parties to a funds transfer other than a Reserve Bank to agree to be liable for consequential damages. Finally, this proposed section provides that where a Reserve Bank is obligated under UCC Article 4A to provide compensation in the form of interest to another party in connection with its handling of a funds transfer over the FedNow Service, the Reserve Bank may do so. In such cases where a Reserve Bank provides compensation in the form of interest, interest would be calculated in accordance with Article 4A. This proposed section adopts rules similar to the rules governing the Fedwire Funds Service in subpart B, with the proposed clarifying amendments to subpart B described above. The Board requests comment on all aspects of the proposed amendments to Regulation J. The Board also requests comment on the following specific questions: 1. The proposed regulation requires a FedNow participant that is a beneficiary's bank to make funds available to the beneficiary immediately after it has accepted the payment order over the FedNow Service. a. Should the Board set out specific time parameters to clarify the meaning of immediately as used in this funds availability requirement? Why or why not? b. What would be the benefits and drawbacks of specifying that immediately as used in this requirement means that the beneficiary's bank must make funds available to the beneficiary within seconds or, alternatively, within one minute after it has accepted the payment order over the FedNow Service?[6] Or, is there another way for the Board to specify the funds availability timeframe that is consistent with improving the speed of the end-to-end process for an instant payment service and continues to align with prevailing market practices over time? 2. The proposed regulation accommodates a feature of the FedNow Service under which a FedNow participant that is the beneficiary's bank may notify its Reserve Bank that it requires additional time to determine whether to accept the payment order over the FedNow Service because it has reasonable cause to believe that the beneficiary is not entitled or permitted to receive payment. Are there other circumstances where a beneficiary's bank should have additional time to determine whether to accept a payment order? If so, what are those circumstances? The Board conducts a competitive impact analysis when it considers an operational or legal change, if that change would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete with the Federal Reserve in providing similar services due to legal differences or due to the Federal Reserve's dominant market position deriving from such legal differences. All operational or legal changes having a substantial effect on payments-system participants will be subject to a competitive-impact analysis, even if competitive effects are not apparent on the face of the proposal. If such legal differences exist, the Board will assess whether the same objectives could be achieved by a modified Start Printed Page 31382proposal with lesser competitive impact or, if not, whether the benefits of the proposal (such as contributing to payments-system efficiency or integrity or other Board objectives) outweigh the materially adverse effect on competition.[7] The Board does not believe that the proposed amendments to Regulation J will have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Reserve Banks in providing similar services due to legal differences. The proposed rule incorporates UCC Article 4A, with revisions to reflect the nature of funds transfers over the FedNow Service and consistent with the purposes of UCC Article 4A. The proposed amendments do not govern similar services provided by private-sector providers. The proposed amendments also do not include provisions that a private-sector provider of similar services could not also adopt to similar effect through rules or operating procedures. Therefore, the Board does not believe that the proposed amendments would affect the competitive position of private-sector providers vis--vis the Reserve Banks. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3506; 5 CFR part 1320 Appendix A.1), the Board may not conduct or sponsor, and a respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The Board reviewed the proposed rule under the authority delegated to the Board by the OMB and determined that it contains no collections of information under the PRA.[8] Accordingly, there is no paperwork burden associated with the proposed rule. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (the RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires agencies either to provide an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with a proposed rule or to certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with section 3(a) of the RFA, the Board has reviewed the proposed regulation. In this case, the proposed rule would apply to all depository institutions that choose to use the Reserve Bank's FedNow Service, but the Board does not believe it will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Nevertheless, this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 in order for the Board to solicit comment on the effect of the proposal on small entities. The Board will, if necessary, conduct a final regulatory flexibility analysis after consideration of comments received during the public comment period. While the Reserve Banks can prescribe by agreement terms and conditions in providing the FedNow Service, the Board believes it is appropriate to bring the FedNow Service within the coverage of Regulation J. As discussed in previous sections, the main objective of the proposed amendments to Regulation J is to establish a new subpart C to govern funds transfers made through the FedNow Service. The proposed amendments would apply to all depository institutions that choose to participate in the FedNow Service regardless of their size. Pursuant to regulations issued by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.201), a small banking organization includes a depository institution with $550 million or less in total assets. Based on call report data, there are approximately 9,460 depository institutions that have total domestic assets of $550 million or less and thus are considered small entities for purposes of the RFA. Other than noted here, there are no new projected reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements and no substantive changes to existing reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements in the proposed amendments to Regulation J. Depository institutions that voluntarily choose to use the FedNow Service will have to comply with the applicable provisions of this proposed rule, which include the requirement on the availability of funds. The Board has not identified any likely duplication and/or potential conflict between the proposed regulatory amendments and any other Federal rule. While some overlap exists between the proposed amendments and EFAA (implemented in Regulation CC), as discussed above, the regulatory overlap does not create conflicting federal rules. Regulation CC's availability requirements apply to all electronic payments and establish the outer bound of when those funds must be made available. The proposed requirements in Regulation J regarding availability establish a shorter time period for when funds must be made available than is required under Regulation CC and applies only to the subset of electronic payments that use the FedNow Service as a term of the service. As discussed above, the Board has not identified any new or substantial change to regulatory burden associated with the proposed amendments to Regulation J, and the Board has not identified any significant alternatives that would otherwise reduce the regulatory burden on small entities. Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Pub. L. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338, 1471, 12 U.S.C. 4809) requires the Federal banking agencies to use plain language in all proposed and final rules published after January 1, 2000. The Board has sought to present the proposed rule in a simple and straightforward manner, and invites comment on the use of plain language and whether any part of the proposed rule could be more clearly stated. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board proposes to amend 12 CFR part 210 as follows: 1. The authority citation for part 210 continues to read as follows: Authority: 12 U.S.C. 248(i), (j), and 248-1, 342, 360, 464, 4001-4010, and 5001-5018. 2. Revise the heading to part 210 as shown above. 3. Revise 210.2 to read as follows: As used in this subpart A, unless the context otherwise requires: Account means an account on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank. A subaccount is an informational record of a subset of transactions that affect an account and is not a separate account. Actually and finally collected funds means cash or any other form of payment that is, or has become, final and irrevocable. Administrative Reserve Bank with respect to an entity means the Reserve Bank in whose District the entity is located, as determined under the procedure described in 204.3(g) of this chapter (Regulation D), even if the entity is not otherwise subject to that section. Bank means any person engaged in the business of banking. A branch or separate office of a bank is a separate bank to the extent provided in the Uniform Commercial Code. Bank draft means a check drawn by one bank on another bank. Banking day means the part of a day on which a bank is open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its banking functions. Cash item means (1) A check other than one classified as a noncash item under this section; or (2) Any other item payable on demand and collectible at par that the Reserve Bank that receives the item is willing to accept as a cash item. Cash item does not include a returned check. Check means a check or an electronic check, as those terms are defined in 229.2 of this chapter (Regulation CC). Clock hour and clock half-hour. (1) Clock hour means a time that is on the hour, such as 1:00, 2:00, etc. (2) Clock half-hour means a time that is on the half-hour, such as 1:30, 2:30, etc. Fedwire Funds Service and Fedwire have the same meaning as that set forth in 210.26. Item. (1) Means (i) An instrument or a promise or order to pay money, whether negotiable or not, that is (A) Payable in a Federal Reserve District[1] (District); (B) Sent by a sender to a Reserve Bank for handling under this subpart; and (C) Collectible in funds acceptable to the Reserve Bank of the District in which the instrument is payable; or (ii) A check. (2) Unless otherwise indicated, item includes both a cash and a noncash item, and includes a returned check sent by a paying or returning bank. Item does not include a check that cannot be collected at par, or a payment order as defined in 210.26(i) and handled under subpart B of this part. The term also does not include an electronically-created item as defined in 229.2 of this chapter (Regulation CC). Nonbank payor means a payor of an item, other than a bank. Noncash item means an item that a receiving Reserve Bank classifies in its operating circulars as requiring special handling. The term also means an item normally received as a cash item if a Reserve Bank decides that special conditions require that it handle the item as a noncash item.

Amend subpart B of part 210 by: a. Revising the heading to subpart B of part 210 to read as follows: b. Removing the words Appendix B of this subpart and Appendix B to this subpart and replace with the words Appendix A of this part 210 wherever they appear. 5. In 210.25, revise paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) to read as follows: (b) * * * (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, this subpart, including Article 4A as set forth in appendix A of this part and operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks issued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, governs the rights and obligations of the following parties with respect to the Fedwire Funds Service: (i) Federal Reserve Banks that send or receive payment orders; (ii) Senders that send payment orders directly to a Federal Reserve Bank; (iii) Receiving banks that receive payment orders directly from a Federal Reserve Bank; (iv) Beneficiaries that receive payment for payment orders by means of credit to an account maintained or used at a Federal Reserve Bank; and (v) Other parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out through Start Printed Page 31384the Fedwire Funds Service to the same extent as if this subpart were considered a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A. (c) Operating Circulars. Each Federal Reserve Bank shall issue an Operating Circular consistent with this subpart that governs the details of its funds-transfer operations in connection with the Fedwire Funds Service and other matters it deems appropriate. Among other things, the Operating Circular may set cut-off times and funds-transfer business days; address security procedures offered by the Federal Reserve Banks to verify the authenticity of a payment order; specify format and media requirements for payment orders; specify the time and method of receipt, execution, and acceptance of a payment order and settlement of a Federal Reserve Bank's payment obligation for purposes of Article 4A; specify service terms governing ancillary features of the Fedwire Funds Service; provide for the acceptance of documents in electronic form to the extent any provision in Article 4A requires an agreement or other document to be in writing; identify messages that are not payment orders; and impose charges for funds-transfer services. 6. Revise 210.26 to read as follows: As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply: Article 4A means Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code as set forth in appendix A of this part, which is incorporated into this subpart in accordance with 210.25(b). Automated clearing house transfer means any transfer designated as an automated clearing house transfer in an operating circular issued by the Federal Reserve Banks. Beneficiary has the same meaning as in Article 4A except that the term is limited to a beneficiary in a funds transfer any portion of which is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service. Beneficiary's bank has the same meaning as in Article 4A, except that: (1) The term is limited to a beneficiary's bank in a funds transfer any portion of which is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service; (2) A Federal Reserve Bank need not be identified in the payment order in order to be the beneficiary's bank; and (3) The term includes a Federal Reserve Bank when that Federal Reserve Bank is the beneficiary of a payment order. Fedwire Funds Service means the funds-transfer system owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks that is used primarily for the transmission and settlement of payment orders governed by this subpart. The Fedwire Funds Service does not include the FedNow Service or the system for making automated clearing house transfers. Interdistrict transfer means a funds transfer involving entries to accounts maintained at two Federal Reserve Banks. Intradistrict transfer means a funds transfer involving entries to accounts maintained at one Federal Reserve Bank. Off-line bank means a bank that sends payment orders to and receives payment orders from a Federal Reserve Bank by telephone orally or by other means other than electronic data transmission. Payment order has the same meaning as in Article 4A except that the term includes only instructions sent or received through the Fedwire Funds Service and does not include automated clearing house transfers or any communication designated in an operating circular issued by a Federal Reserve Bank under this subpart as not being a payment order. Receiving bank has the same meaning as in Article 4A except that the term is limited to a receiving bank in a funds transfer any portion of which is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service. Sender has the same meaning as in Article 4A except that the term is limited to a sender in a funds transfer any portion of which is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service. Sender's account, receiving bank's account, and beneficiary's account mean the reserve, clearing, or other funds deposit account at a Federal Reserve Bank maintained or used by the sender, receiving bank, or beneficiary, respectively. Sender's Federal Reserve Bank and receiving bank's Federal Reserve Bank mean the Federal Reserve Bank at which the sender or receiving bank, respectively, maintains or uses an account. 7. In 210.28, revise paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) to read as follows: (b) Overdrafts. (1) A sender does not have the right to an overdraft in the sender's account. In the event an overdraft is created, the overdraft shall be due and payable immediately, without the need for a demand by the Federal Reserve Bank, at the earliest of the following times: (i) At the end of the Fedwire Funds Service funds-transfer business day; (ii) At the time the Federal Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the sender; or (iii) At the time the sender suspends payments or is closed. (2) The sender shall have in its account, at the time the overdraft is due and payable, a balance of actually and finally collected funds sufficient to cover the aggregate amount of all its obligations to the Federal Reserve Bank, whether the obligations result from the execution of a payment order or otherwise. (3) To secure any overdraft, as well as any other obligation due or to become due to its Federal Reserve Bank, each sender, by sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that is accepted by the Federal Reserve Bank, grants to the Federal Reserve Bank a security interest in all of the sender's assets in the possession or control of, or held for the account of, the Federal Reserve Bank. The security interest attaches when an overdraft, or any other obligation to the Federal Reserve Bank, becomes due and payable. 8. In 210.30, revise paragraphs (b) and (c) to read as follows: (b) Selection of an intermediary bank. For an interdistrict transfer through the Fedwire Funds Service, a Federal Reserve Bank is authorized and directed to execute a payment order through another Federal Reserve Bank. A sender shall not send a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that requires the Federal Reserve Bank to send a payment order to an intermediary bank (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) unless that intermediary bank is designated in the sender's payment order. A sender shall not send to a Federal Reserve Bank a payment order through the Fedwire Funds Service that instructs use by a Federal Reserve Bank of a funds-transfer system or means of transmission other than the Fedwire Funds Service unless the Federal Reserve Bank agrees with the sender in writing to follow such instructions. (c) Execution date and payment date. A sender shall not send a payment order through the Fedwire Funds Service that instructs a Federal Reserve Bank to execute the payment order or to pay the beneficiary on a funds-transfer business day that is later than the Fedwire Funds Service funds-transfer business day on which the order is received by the Federal Reserve Bank, unless the Federal Reserve Bank agrees with the Start Printed Page 31385sender in writing to follow such instructions. 9. In 210.32, revise the section heading and paragraph (b) to read as follows: (b) Payment of compensation. (1) A Federal Reserve Bank shall satisfy its obligation, or that of another Federal Reserve Bank, to pay compensation in the form of interest under Article 4A by paying such compensation in the form of interest to a sender, receiving bank, beneficiary, or another party to the funds transfer that is entitled to such payment in an amount that is calculated in accordance with section 4A-506 of Article 4A. (2) If the sender or receiving bank that is the recipient of the payment of compensation is not the party entitled to compensation under Article 4A, the sender or receiving bank shall pass through the benefit of the compensation by making an interest payment, as of the day the compensation was paid by the Federal Reserve Bank, to the party entitled to compensation. The interest payment that is made to the party entitled to compensation shall not be less than the value of the compensation that was paid by the Federal Reserve Bank to the sender or receiving bank. The party entitled to compensation may agree to accept compensation in a form other than a direct interest payment, provided that such an alternative form of compensation is not less than the value of the interest payment that otherwise would be made. 10. In Appendix A of subpart B of part 210: a. Under Section 210.25Authority, Purpose, and Scope, revise paragraphs (a), (b)(1) through (6), and (c); b. Revise Section 210.26Definitions; c. Under Section 210.28Agreement of Sender, revise paragraphs (a), (b)(1) and (2), and (c)(2); d. Under Section 210.30Payment Orders, revise paragraphs (b)(2) and (c); and e. Under Section 210.32Federal Reserve Bank Liability; Payment of Compensation, revise the heading and paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(1) through (3), and (c). The revisions read as follows: (a) Authority and purpose. Section 210.25(a) states that the purpose of subpart B of this part is to provide rules to govern funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service and recites the Board's rulemaking authority for this subpart. Subpart B of this part is federal law and is not a funds-transfer system rule as defined in section 4A-501(b) of Article 4A, Funds Transfers, of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as set forth in appendix A of this part. Certain provisions of Article 4A may not be varied by a funds-transfer system rule, but under section 4A-107, regulations of the Board and operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks supersede inconsistent provisions of Article 4A to the extent of the inconsistency. In addition, regulations of the Board may preempt inconsistent provisions of state law. Accordingly, subpart B of this part supersedes or preempts inconsistent provisions of state law. It does not affect state law governing funds transfers that does not conflict with the provisions of subpart B of this part, such as Article 4A as enacted in any state, as such state law may apply to parties to funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service whose rights and obligations are not governed by subpart B of this part. (b) Scope. (1) Subpart B of this part incorporates the provisions of Article 4A set forth in appendix A of this part. The provisions set forth expressly in the sections of subpart B of this part supersede or preempt any inconsistent provisions of Article 4A as set forth in appendix A of this part or as enacted in any state. The official comments to Article 4A are not incorporated in subpart B of this part or this commentary to subpart B of this part, but the official comments may be useful in interpreting Article 4A as set forth in appendix A of this part. Because section 4A-105 refers to other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (e.g., definitions in article 1 of the UCC), these other provisions of the UCC, as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which is now also known as the Uniform Law Commission, and the American Law Institute, from time to time, are also incorporated into subpart B of this part. Subpart B of this part applies to any party to a funds transfer over the Fedwire Funds Service that is in privity with a Federal Reserve Bank. These parties include a sender (bank or nonbank) that sends a payment order directly to a Federal Reserve Bank, a receiving bank that receives a payment order directly from a Federal Reserve Bank, and a beneficiary that receives credit to an account that it uses or maintains at a Federal Reserve Bank as payment for a payment order accepted by a Federal Reserve Bank. Other parties to a funds transfer over the Fedwire Funds Service are covered by subpart B of this part to the same extent subpart B would apply to them if subpart B were a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A that selected subpart B of this part as the governing law. (2) The scope of the applicability of a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A is specified in section 4A-501(b), and the scope of the choice of law provision is specified in section 4A-507(c). Under section 4A-507(c), a choice of law provision is binding on the participants in a funds-transfer system and certain other parties having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used for the funds transfer and of the choice of law provision. The Uniform Commercial Code provides that a person has notice of a fact when the person has actual knowledge of it, receives a notice or notification of it, or has reason to know that it exists from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question. (See UCC section 1-202.) However, under sections 4A-507(b) and 4A-507(d), a choice of law by agreement of the parties takes precedence over a choice of law made by funds-transfer system rule. (3) If originators, receiving banks, and beneficiaries that are not in privity with a Federal Reserve Bank have the notice contemplated by section 4A-507(c) or if those parties agree to be bound by subpart B of this part, subpart B of this part generally would apply to payment orders between those remote parties, including participants in other funds-transfer systems. For example, a payment order may be sent from an originator's bank through a funds-transfer system other than the Fedwire Funds Service to a receiving bank which, in turn, executes that payment order by sending a payment order through the Fedwire Funds Service. Similarly, a Federal Reserve Bank may send a payment order through the Fedwire Funds Service to a receiving bank that sends it through a funds-transfer system other than the Fedwire Funds Service to the beneficiary's bank. In the first example, if the originator's bank has notice that the Fedwire Funds Service may be used to effect part of the funds transfer, the sending of the payment order through the other funds-transfer system to the receiving bank will be governed by subpart B of this part unless the parties to the payment order have agreed otherwise. In the second example, if the beneficiary's bank has notice that the Fedwire Funds Service may be used to effect part of the funds transfer, the sending of the payment order to the beneficiary's bank through the other funds-transfer system will be governed by subpart B of this part unless the parties have agreed otherwise. In both cases, the other funds-transfer system's rules would also apply to, at a minimum, the portion of these funds transfers being made through that funds transfer system. Because subpart B of this part is federal law, subpart B of this part will take precedence over any funds-transfer system rule applicable to the remote sender or receiving bank or to a Federal Reserve Bank to the extent of any inconsistency. If remote parties to a funds transfer, a portion of which is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service, have expressly selected by agreement, in accordance with section 4A-507(b), a law other than subpart B of this part, subpart B of this part would not take precedence over the choice of law made by the agreement even though the remote parties had notice that the Fedwire Funds Service might be used and of the governing law. (See section 4A-507(d).) In Start Printed Page 31386addition, subpart B of this part would not apply to a funds transfer sent through another funds-transfer system where no Federal Reserve Bank handles the funds transfer, even though settlement for the funds transfer is made by means of a separate net settlement or funds transfer through the Fedwire Funds Service. (4) Under section 4A-108, Article 4A does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) (15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq.). In general, Fedwire funds transfers to or from consumer accounts are exempt from the EFTA and Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005). A funds transfer from a consumer originator or a funds transfer to a consumer beneficiary could be carried out in part through the Fedwire Funds Service and in part through an automated clearinghouse or other means that is subject to the EFTA or Regulation E. In these cases, subpart B would not govern the portion of the funds transfer that is governed by the EFTA or Regulation E. (See the commentary to 210.26 in this appendix, Payment Order.) (5) Section 919 of the EFTA, however, governs remittance transfers, which may include funds transfers over the Fedwire Funds Service. Section 919 of the EFTA sets out the obligations of remittance transfer providers with respect to consumer senders of remittance transfers. Section 919 of the EFTA generally does not affect the rights and obligations of financial institutions involved in a remittance transfer. To the extent that a Fedwire funds transfer is a remittance transfer governed by section 919 of the EFTA, it continues to be governed by subpart B of this part, except that, in the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of subpart B of this part and section 919 of the EFTA, section 919 of the EFTA shall prevail. For example, a consumer may initiate a remittance transfer governed by EFTA section 919 from the consumer's account at a depository institution, and the depository institution may initiate that transfer by sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank through the Fedwire Funds Service. If the consumer subsequently exercised the right to cancel the remittance transfer and obtain a refund under the terms of section 919 of the EFTA, the depository institution would be required to comply with section 919 even if the institution does not have a right to reverse the payment order sent to the Federal Reserve Bank under subpart B of this part. (6) Finally, section 4A-404(a) provides that a beneficiary's bank is obliged to pay the amount of a payment order to the beneficiary on the payment date unless acceptance of the payment order occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank. The Expedited Funds Availability Act provides that funds received by a bank by wire transfer shall be available for withdrawal not later than the business day after the business day on which such funds are received (12 U.S.C. 4002(a)). That act also preempts any provision of state law that was not effective on September 1, 1989, that is inconsistent with that act or its implementing Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229). Accordingly, the Expedited Funds Availability Act and Regulation CC may preempt section 4A-404(a) as enacted in any state. In order to ensure that section 4A-404(a), or other provisions of Article 4A, as incorporated in subpart B of this part, do not take precedence over provisions of the Expedited Funds Availability Act, this section 210.25(b)(4) provides that where subpart B of this part establishes rights or obligations that are also governed by the Expedited Funds Availability Act or Regulation CC, the Expedited Funds Availability Act or Regulation CC provision shall apply and subpart B of this part shall not apply. (c) Operating Circulars. The Federal Reserve Banks issue Operating Circulars consistent with this subpart that contain additional provisions applicable to payment orders and other messages sent through the Fedwire Funds Service. Under section 4A-107, these Operating Circulars supersede inconsistent provisions of Article 4A, both as set forth in appendix A of this part and as enacted in any state. These Operating Circulars are not funds-transfer system rules, but, by their terms, they are binding on all parties covered by this subpart. Article 4A defines many terms (e.g., beneficiary, intermediary bank, receiving bank, security procedure) used in subpart B of this part. These terms are defined or listed in sections 4A-103 through 4A-105. These terms, such as the term bank (defined in section 4A-105(d)(2)), may differ from comparable terms in subpart A and subpart C of this part. As subpart B of this part incorporates consistent provisions of Article 4A, it incorporates these definitions unless these terms are expressly defined otherwise in subpart B of this part. Subpart B modifies the definitions of five Article 4A terms, beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, payment order, receiving bank, and sender. Subpart B also defines terms not defined in Article 4A. Article 4A. Article 4A means the version of that article of the Uniform Commercial Code set forth in appendix A of this part. It does not refer to the law of any particular state unless the context indicates otherwise. Subject to the express provisions of this subpart, this version of Article 4A is incorporated into this subpart and made federal law for transactions covered by subpart B of this part. (See 210.25(b)(1) and accompanying commentary.) Because section 4A-105 refers to other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (e.g., definitions in article 1 of the UCC), these other provisions of the UCC, as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which is now also known as the Uniform Law Commission, and the American Law Institute, from time to time, are also incorporated into subpart B of this part. Beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, receiving bank, and sender. The definitions of beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, receiving bank, and sender in subpart B of this part differ from the definitions in sections 4A-103(a)(2) through (4). The subpart B definitions clarify that, for the purposes of subpart B of this part, these terms are limited to parties in a funds transfer that is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service. For example, the parties to a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service would be governed by subpart C of this part, and would not be a beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, receiving bank, or sender governed by subpart B of this part. The subpart B definition of beneficiary's bank further clarifies that where a Federal Reserve Bank functions as the beneficiary's bank, it need not be identified in the payment order as the beneficiary's bank and that a Federal Reserve Bank that receives a payment order as beneficiary is also the beneficiary's bank with respect to that payment order. Fedwire Funds Service. This term refers to the funds-transfer system owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks that is governed by this subpart. The term does not refer to any particular computer, telecommunications facility, or funds transfer, but rather to the system as a whole, which may include transfers by telephone or by written instrument in particular circumstances. The term does not include the FedNow Service or the system used for automated clearing house transfers. Off-line bank. Most Fedwire payment orders are sent electronically from a sender to a Federal Reserve Bank or from a Federal Reserve Bank to a receiving bank. Banks that send payment orders to Federal Reserve Banks electronically are often referred to as on-line banks. Some Fedwire Funds Service participants, however, send payment orders to a Federal Reserve Bank or receive payment orders from a Federal Reserve Bank orally by telephone or, in unusual circumstances, in writing. A bank that does not use either a terminal or a computer that links it electronically to a terminal or computer at its Federal Reserve Bank to send payment orders through the Fedwire Funds Service is an off-line bank. Payment Order. (1) The definition of payment order in subpart B of this part differs from the section 4A-103(a)(1) definition. The subpart B definition clarifies that, for the purposes of subpart B of this part, the term includes only instructions transmitted through the Fedwire Funds Service. For example, instructions transmitted through the FedNow Service would be governed by subpart C of this part, and not subpart B of this part. Additionally, the subpart B definition provides that certain messages that are transmitted through the Fedwire Funds Service are not payment orders. Federal Reserve Banks and banks participating in the Fedwire Funds Service send various types of messages relating to payment orders or to other matters, through the Fedwire Funds Service, that are not intended to be payment orders. In some cases, messages sent through the Fedwire Funds Service, such as certain requests for credit transfer, may be payment orders under Article 4A, but are not treated as payment orders under subpart B of this part because they are not an instruction to a Federal Reserve Bank to pay or cause another bank to pay money. Under the subpart B definition, these messages are not payment Start Printed Page 31387orders governed by subpart B of this part. The operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks may specify those messages that may be transmitted through the Fedwire Funds Service but that are not payment orders. (2) Subpart B of this part, including its incorporation of Article 4A, governs a payment order even though the originator's or beneficiary's account may be a consumer account established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Under section 4A-108, Article 4A does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. That act and Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005) implementing it do not apply to funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service (see 15 U.S.C. 1693a(7)(B) and 12 CFR 1005.3(c)(3)), except that section 919 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act may govern a Fedwire funds transfer that is a remittance transfer. Such remittance transfers that are Fedwire funds transfers continue to be governed by subpart B of this part. Thus, subpart B of this part applies to all funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service even though some such transfers involve originators or beneficiaries who are consumers. (See also 210.25(b) and accompanying commentary.) (a) Payment of sender's obligation to a Federal Reserve Bank. When a sender sends a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts the payment order by issuing a conforming order executing the sender's payment order, under section 4A-402 the sender is indebted to the Federal Reserve Bank for the amount of the payment order. Section 4A-403 specifies the various methods by which a sender may settle the obligation under section 4A-402. With respect to a payment order sent through the Fedwire Funds Service, the obligation of a sender (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) is settled by a debit to the account of the sender at a Federal Reserve Bank. Section 210.28(a) provides that a sender, other than a Federal Reserve Bank, that maintains or uses an account at a Federal Reserve Bank authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank to debit that account so that the Federal Reserve Bank can obtain payment for the payment order. (b) Overdrafts. (1) In some cases, debits to a sender's account will create an overdraft in the sender's account. The Board and the Federal Reserve Banks have established policies concerning when a Federal Reserve Bank will permit a bank to incur an overdraft in its account at a Federal Reserve Bank. These policies do not give a bank or other sender a right to an overdraft in its account. Subpart B clarifies that a sender does not have a right to such an overdraft. If an overdraft arises, it becomes immediately due and payable at the earliest of the following times: The end of the Fedwire Funds Service funds-transfer business day; the time the Federal Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice to the sender; or the time that the sender suspends payments or is closed by governmental action, such as the appointment of a receiver. In some cases, a Federal Reserve Bank extends its Fedwire Funds Service operations beyond the standard cut-off time for that funds-transfer business day. For the purposes of this section, unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve Bank making such an extension, an overdraft becomes due and payable at the end of the extended operating hours. An overdraft becomes due and payable prior to a Federal Reserve Bank's cut-off time if the Federal Reserve Bank deems itself insecure and gives notice to the sender. A Federal Reserve Bank that deems itself insecure may give such notice in accordance with the provisions on notice in section 1-202(d) of the UCC, in accordance with any other applicable law or agreement, or by any other reasonable means. An overdraft also becomes due and payable at the time that a bank is closed or suspends payments. For example, an overdraft becomes due and payable if a receiver is appointed for the bank or the bank is prevented from making payments by governmental order. The Federal Reserve Bank need not make demand on the sender for the overdraft to become due and payable. (2) A sender must cover any overdraft and any other obligation of the sender to the Federal Reserve Bank by the time the overdraft becomes due and payable. By sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank, the sender grants a security interest to the Federal Reserve Bank in all of the assets of the sender possessed or controlled by, or held for the account of, the Federal Reserve Bank in order to secure all obligations due or to become due to the Federal Reserve Bank. The security interest attaches when the overdraft, or other obligation of the sender to the Federal Reserve Bank, becomes due and payable. The security interest does not apply to assets held by the sender as custodian or trustee for the sender's customers or third parties. Once an overdraft is due and payable, a Federal Reserve Bank may exercise its right of setoff, liquidate collateral, or take other similar action to satisfy the obligation the sender owes to the Federal Reserve Bank. (c) * * * (2) Section 4A-505 provides that, in order for a customer to assert a claim objecting to a debit to its account by a receiving bank, the customer must notify the receiving bank of its objection within one year after the customer received notification reasonably identifying the payment order. Subpart B of this part does not vary this one-year claim preclusion period. (b) * * * (2) This section provides that in an interdistrict transfer, a Federal Reserve Bank is authorized and directed to select another Federal Reserve Bank as an intermediary bank. A sender may, however, instruct a Federal Reserve Bank to use a particular intermediary bank by designating that bank as the bank to be credited by that Federal Reserve Bank (or the second Federal Reserve Bank in the case of an interdistrict transfer) in its payment order, in which case the Federal Reserve Bank will send the payment order to that bank if that bank receives payment orders through the Fedwire Funds Service. A sender may not instruct a Federal Reserve Bank to use its discretion to select an intermediary bank other than a Federal Reserve Bank or an intermediary bank designated by the sender. In addition, a sender may not send a payment order through the Fedwire Funds Service that instructs a Federal Reserve Bank to use a funds-transfer system or means of transmission other than the Fedwire Funds Service unless the sender and the Federal Reserve Bank agree in writing to the use of that funds-transfer system or means of transmission. (c) Execution date and payment date. Generally, the Fedwire Funds Service is a same-day value transfer system through which funds may be transferred from the originator to the beneficiary on the same funds-transfer business day. A sender may not send a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that specifies an execution date or payment date later than the day on which the payment order is issued, unless the sender of the order and the Federal Reserve Bank agree in writing to the arrangement. (a) * * * (2) This section does not affect the ability of other parties to a funds transfer to agree to be liable for consequential damages, the liability of a Federal Reserve Bank under section 4A-404 (relating to obligation of beneficiary's bank to pay and give notice to beneficiary), or the liability to parties governed by subpart B of this part for claims not based on the handling of a payment order under subpart B of this part. (b) Payment of compensation. (1) Under article 4A, a Federal Reserve Bank may be required to pay compensation in the form of interest to another party in connection with its handling of a funds transfer. For example, payment of compensation in the form of interest is required in certain situations pursuant to sections 4A-204 (relating to refund of payment and duty of customer to report with respect to unauthorized payment order), 4A-209 (relating to acceptance of payment order), 4A-210 (relating to rejection of payment order), 4A-304 (relating to duty of sender to report erroneously executed payment order), 4A-305 (relating to liability for late or improper execution or failure to execute a payment order), 4A-402 (relating to obligation of sender to pay receiving bank), and 4A-404 (relating to obligation of beneficiary's bank to pay and give notice to beneficiary). (2) Section 210.32(b) requires Federal Reserve Banks to provide compensation through payment in the form of interest. Under section 4A-506(a), the amount of such interest may be determined by agreement between the sender and receiving bank or by funds-transfer system rule. If there is no such agreement, under section 4A-506(b), the amount of interest is based on the federal funds rate. Similarly, compensation in the form of interest will be paid to government Start Printed Page 31388senders, receiving banks, or beneficiaries described in 210.25(d) if they are entitled to interest under subpart B of this part. A Federal Reserve Bank may also, in its discretion, pay compensation in the form of interest directly to a remote party to a Fedwire funds transfer that is entitled to interest, rather than providing compensation to its sender or receiving bank. (3) If a sender or receiving bank that received a payment of compensation is not the party entitled to compensation under Article 4A, the sender or receiving bank must pass the benefit of the payment made to it to the party that is entitled to compensation. The benefit may be passed on either in the form of a direct payment of interest or in the form of a compensating balance if the party entitled to interest agrees to accept the other form of compensation. In the latter case, the value of the compensating balance must be at least equivalent to the value of the interest payment that otherwise would have been provided. (c) Nonwaiver of right of recovery. Several sections of Article 4A allow a party to a funds transfer to make a claim pursuant to the applicable law of mistake and restitution. Nothing in subpart B of this part or any operating circular issued in accordance with subpart B of this part waives any such claim by a Federal Reserve Bank. A Federal Reserve Bank, however, may waive such a claim by express written agreement in order to settle litigation or for other purposes. 11. Remove Appendix B of subpart B of part 210. 12. Add subpart C of part 210 to read as follows: Appendix A of Subpart C of Part 210Commentary (a) Authority and purpose. This subpart provides rules to govern funds transfers through the FedNow Service, and has been issued pursuant to the Federal Reserve Actsection 13 (12 U.S.C. 342), paragraph (f) of section 19 (12 U.S.C. 464), paragraph 14 of section 16 (12 U.S.C. 248(o)), and paragraphs (i) and (j) of section 11 (12 U.S.C. 248(i) and (j))and other laws and has the force and effect of federal law. This subpart is not a funds-transfer system rule as defined in Section 4A-501(b) of Article 4A. (b) Scope. (1) This subpart incorporates the provisions of Article 4A set forth in appendix A of this part. In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of the sections of this subpart and appendix A of this part, the provisions of the sections of this subpart shall prevail. (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, this subpart, including Article 4A as incorporated herein and operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks issued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, governs the rights and obligations of the following parties with respect to the FedNow Service: (i) Federal Reserve Banks that send or receive payment orders; (ii) Senders that send payment orders directly to a Federal Reserve Bank; (iii) Receiving banks that receive payment orders directly from a Federal Reserve Bank; (iv) Beneficiaries that receive payment for payment orders by means of credit to the beneficiary's settlement account; and (v) Other parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out through the FedNow Service to the same extent as if this subpart were considered a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A. (3) A Federal Reserve Bank that is not the sender's Federal Reserve Bank, receiving bank's Federal Reserve Bank, or beneficiary's Federal Reserve Bank is not a party to the funds transfer for purposes of this subpart and Article 4A. (4) This subpart governs a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service, even if a portion of the funds transfer is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, but in the event of an inconsistency between the provisions this subpart and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. (c) Operating Circulars. Each Federal Reserve Bank shall issue an Operating Circular consistent with this subpart that governs the details of its funds-transfer operations in connection with the FedNow Service and other matters it deems appropriate. Among other things, the Operating Circular may: Set cut-off times and funds-transfer business days; address security procedures offered by the Federal Reserve Banks to verify the authenticity of a payment order; specify format and media requirements for payment orders; specify the time and method of receipt, execution, and acceptance of a payment order and settlement of a Federal Reserve Bank's payment obligation for purposes of Article 4A; prescribe time limits for the processing of payment orders; specify service terms governing ancillary features of the FedNow Service; provide for the acceptance of documents in electronic form to the extent any provision in Article 4A requires an agreement or other document to be in writing; identify messages that are not payment orders; and impose charges for funds-transfer services. (d) Government senders, receiving banks, and beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the statutes of the United States, the parties specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section include a department, agency, instrumentality, independent establishment, or office of the United States, or a wholly-owned or controlled government corporation. (e) Financial messaging standards. Financial messaging standards (e.g., ISO 20022), including the financial messaging components, elements, technical documentation, tags, and terminology used to implement those standards, do not confer or connote legal status or responsibilities. This subpart, including Article 4A as incorporated herein, and the operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks issued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section govern the rights and obligations of parties to funds transfers sent through the FedNow Service as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. To the extent there is any inconsistency between a financial messaging standard adopted by the Federal Reserve Banks for the FedNow Service and this subpart, this subpart shall prevail. As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply: Article 4A means Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code as set forth in appendix A of this part, which is incorporated into this subpart in accordance with 210.40(b). Beneficiary has the same meaning as in Article 4A, except that the term is limited to a beneficiary in a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service. Beneficiary's bank has the same meaning as in Article 4A, except that: (1) The term is limited to a beneficiary's bank in a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service; (2) A Federal Reserve Bank need not be identified in the payment order in order to be the beneficiary's bank; andStart Printed Page 31389 (3) The term includes a Federal Reserve Bank when that Federal Reserve Bank is the beneficiary of a payment order. Federal Reserve Bank with respect to an entity means the Federal Reserve Bank in whose District the entity is located, as determined under the procedure described in Part 204 of this chapter (Regulation D), even if the entity is not otherwise subject to that section, or, if the entity maintains an account on the books of a different Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank at which the entity maintains an account. The FedNow Service means the funds-transfer system owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks to support instant payments that is used primarily for the transmission and settlement of payment orders governed by this subpart. The FedNow Service does not include the Fedwire Funds Service. Interdistrict transfer means a funds transfer involving entries to settlement accounts maintained at two Federal Reserve Banks. Payment order has the same meaning as in Article 4A, except that the term includes only instructions sent or received through the FedNow Service, and does not include automated clearing house transfers or any communication designated as not being a payment order in an Operating Circular issued by a Federal Reserve Bank under this subpart. Receiving bank has the same meaning as in Article 4A, except that the term is limited to a receiving bank in a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service. Sender has the same meaning as in Article 4A, except that the term is limited to a sender in a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service. Sender's settlement account, receiving bank's settlement account, and beneficiary's settlement account mean an account on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank maintained by the sender, receiving bank, or beneficiary, respectively. The term also includes any account on a Federal Reserve Bank's books used with respect to the FedNow Service by the sender, receiving bank, or beneficiary, respectively, by agreement with its Federal Reserve Bank, any other Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained, and the account-holder. (a) Reliance by a Federal Reserve Bank on number to identify a beneficiary's bank. A Federal Reserve Bank that receives a payment order from a sender containing a number that identifies the beneficiary's bank may rely on the number, even if it identifies a bank different from the bank identified by name in the payment order, if the Federal Reserve Bank does not know of such an inconsistency in identification. A Federal Reserve Bank has no duty to detect any such inconsistency in identification. (b) Reliance by a Federal Reserve Bank on number to identify beneficiary. A Federal Reserve Bank, acting as a beneficiary's bank, that receives a payment order from a sender containing a number that identifies the beneficiary may rely on the number, even if it identifies a person different from the person identified by name in the payment order, if the Federal Reserve Bank does not know of such an inconsistency in identification. A Federal Reserve Bank has no duty to detect any such inconsistency in identification. (a) Payment of sender's obligation to a Federal Reserve Bank. A sender (other than a Federal Reserve Bank), by maintaining or using a settlement account with a Federal Reserve Bank, authorizes the sender's Federal Reserve Bank to obtain payment for the sender's payment orders by debiting, or causing any other Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained to debit, the amount of the payment order from the settlement account. The sender remains responsible for payment if the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained does not, for any reason, obtain payment by debiting that account. (b) Overdrafts. (1) A sender does not have the right to an overdraft in its settlement account. In the event an overdraft is created, the overdraft shall be due and payable immediately, without the need for a demand by the Federal Reserve Bank, at the earliest of the following times: (i) At the end of the FedNow funds-transfer business day; (ii) At the time the Federal Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the sender; or (iii) At the time the sender suspends payments or is closed. (2) The sender shall have in its settlement account, at the time the overdraft is due and payable, a balance of actually and finally collected funds sufficient to cover the aggregate amount of all its obligations to the Federal Reserve Bank, whether the obligations result from the acceptance of a payment order or otherwise. (3) To secure any overdraft, as well as any other obligation due or to become due to its Federal Reserve Bank, a sender, by sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that is accepted by the Federal Reserve Bank, grants to the Federal Reserve Bank a security interest in all of its assets in the possession or control of, or held for the account of, the Federal Reserve Bank. The security interest attaches when an overdraft, or any other obligation to the Federal Reserve Bank, becomes due and payable. (4) A Federal Reserve Bank may take any action authorized by law to recover the amount of an overdraft that is due and payable, including, but not limited to, the exercise of rights of set off, the realization on any available collateral, and any other rights it may have as a creditor under applicable law. (5) If a sender, other than a government sender described in 210.40(d), incurs an overdraft in its settlement account as a result of a debit to the account by a Federal Reserve Bank under paragraph (a) of this section, the settlement account will be subject to any applicable overdraft charges, regardless of whether the overdraft has become due and payable. A Federal Reserve Bank may debit the settlement account under paragraph (a) of this section immediately on acceptance of the payment order. (c) Review of payment orders. A sender, by sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank, agrees that for the purposes of sections 4A-204(a) and 4A-304 of Article 4A, a reasonable time to notify a Federal Reserve Bank of the relevant facts concerning an unauthorized or erroneously executed payment order is within 60 calendar days after the sender receives notice that the payment order was accepted or that the sender's settlement account was debited with respect to the payment order. (a) Payment. A receiving bank (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) that receives a payment order from its Federal Reserve Bank authorizes that Federal Reserve Bank to pay for the payment order by crediting, or causing any other Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained to credit, the amount of the payment order to the settlement account. (b) Funds availability. (1) A beneficiary's bank (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) that accepts a payment order over the FedNow Service is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order Start Printed Page 31390immediately after its acceptance of the payment order, by crediting an account of the beneficiary in accordance with section 4A-405(a) of Article 4A. The rights and obligations with respect to the availability of funds are also governed by the Expedited Funds Availability Act and the Board's Regulation CC, Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks. (2) Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or any Operating Circular issued hereunder shall create any rights that the beneficiary or any party other than a Federal Reserve Bank may assert against the beneficiary's bank, or affect any liability of the beneficiary's bank to the beneficiary or any party other than a Federal Reserve Bank under Article 4A or other law. (3) In circumstances where the beneficiary's bank (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) has reasonable cause to believe that the beneficiary is not entitled or permitted to receive payment, the beneficiary's bank may notify its Federal Reserve Bank that it requires additional time to determine whether to accept the payment order. In the event the beneficiary's bank gives such notice to its Federal Reserve Bank, for purposes of this subpart and Article 4A the beneficiary's bank does not accept the payment order upon its receipt of payment in the amount of the payment order by a Federal Reserve Bank. (a) Rejection. A sender shall not send a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank unless authorized to do so by the Federal Reserve Bank. A Federal Reserve Bank may reject, or impose conditions that must be satisfied before it will accept, a payment order for any reason. (b) Selection of an intermediary bank. For an interdistrict transfer through the FedNow Service, a Federal Reserve Bank is authorized and directed to execute a payment order through another Federal Reserve Bank. A sender shall not send a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that requires the Federal Reserve Bank to send a payment order to an intermediary bank (other than a Federal Reserve Bank). A sender shall not send to a Federal Reserve Bank a payment order through the FedNow Service that instructs use by a Federal Reserve Bank of a funds-transfer system or means of transmission other than the FedNow Service, unless the Federal Reserve Bank agrees with the sender in writing to follow such instructions. (c) Execution Date and Payment Date. A sender shall not issue a payment order through the FedNow Service that instructs a Federal Reserve Bank to execute the payment order or to pay the beneficiary on a FedNow funds-transfer business day that is later than the funds-transfer business day on which the order is received by the Federal Reserve Bank, unless the Federal Reserve Bank agrees with the sender in writing to follow such instructions. (a) Payment to a receiving bank. Payment of a Federal Reserve Bank's obligation to pay a receiving bank (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) occurs at the earlier of the time when the amount of the payment order is credited to the receiving bank's settlement account or when the payment order is sent to the receiving bank. (b) Payment to a beneficiary. Payment by a Federal Reserve Bank to a beneficiary of a payment order, where the Federal Reserve Bank is the beneficiary's bank, occurs at the earlier of the time when the amount of the payment order is credited to the beneficiary's settlement account or when notice of the credit is sent to the beneficiary. (a) Damages. In connection with its handling of a payment order under this subpart, a Federal Reserve Bank shall not be liable to a sender, receiving bank, beneficiary, or other Federal Reserve Bank, governed by this subpart, for any damages other than those payable under Article 4A. A Federal Reserve Bank shall not agree to be liable to a sender, receiving bank, beneficiary, or other Federal Reserve Bank for consequential damages under section 4A-305(d) of Article 4A. (b) Payment of compensation. (1) A Federal Reserve Bank shall satisfy its obligation, or that of another Federal Reserve Bank, to pay compensation in the form of interest under Article 4A by paying such compensation to a sender, receiving bank, beneficiary, or another party to the funds transfer that is entitled to such payment in an amount that is calculated in accordance with section 4A-506 of Article 4A. (2) If the sender or receiving bank that is the recipient of the payment of compensation is not the party entitled to compensation under Article 4A, the sender or receiving bank shall pass through the benefit of the compensation by making an interest payment, as of the day the compensation was paid by the Federal Reserve Bank, to the party entitled to compensation. The interest payment that is made to the party entitled to compensation shall not be less than the value of the compensation that was paid by the Federal Reserve Bank to the sender or receiving bank. The party entitled to compensation may agree to accept compensation in a form other than a direct interest payment, provided that such an alternative form of compensation is not less than the value of the interest payment that otherwise would be made. (c) Nonwaiver of right of recovery. Nothing in this subpart or any operating circular issued hereunder shall constitute, or be construed as constituting, a waiver by a Federal Reserve Bank of a cause of action for recovery under any applicable law of mistake and restitution. The Commentary provides background material to explain the intent of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) in adopting a particular provision in the subpart and to help readers interpret that provision. In some comments, examples are offered. The Commentary constitutes an official Board interpretation of subpart C of this part. Commentary is not provided for every provision of subpart C of this part, as some provisions are self-explanatory. (a) Authority and purpose. Section 210.40(a) states that the purpose of subpart C of this part is to provide rules to govern funds transfers through the FedNow Service and recites the Board's rulemaking authority for this subpart. Subpart C of this part is federal law and is not a funds-transfer system rule, as defined in section 4A-501(b) of Article 4A, Funds Transfers, of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as set forth in appendix A of this part. Certain provisions of Article 4A may not be varied by a funds-transfer system rule, but under section 4A-107, regulations of the Board and Operating Circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks supersede inconsistent provisions of Article 4A to the extent of the inconsistency. In addition, regulations of the Board may preempt inconsistent provisions of state law. Accordingly, subpart C of this part supersedes or preempts inconsistent provisions of state law. It does not affect state law governing funds transfers that does not conflict with the provisions of subpart C of this part, such as Article 4A, as enacted in any state, as such state law may apply to parties to funds transfers through the FedNow Service whose rights and obligations are not governed by subpart C of this part. (b) Scope. (1) Subpart C of this part incorporates the provisions of Article 4A set forth in appendix A of this part. The provisions set forth expressly in the sections of subpart C of this part supersede or preempt any inconsistent provisions of Article 4A as set forth in appendix A of this part or as enacted in any state. The official comments to Article 4A are not incorporated Start Printed Page 31391in subpart C of this part or this commentary to subpart C of this part, but the official comments may be useful in interpreting Article 4A as set forth in appendix A of this part. Because section 4A-105 refers to other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (e.g., definitions in article 1 of the UCC), these other provisions of the UCC, as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which is now also known as the Uniform Law Commission, and the American Law Institute, from time to time, are also incorporated into subpart C of this part. Subpart C of this part applies to any party to a funds transfer sent through the FedNow Service that is in privity with a Federal Reserve Bank. These parties include a sender (bank or nonbank) that sends a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service, a receiving bank that receives a payment order from a Federal Reserve Bank, and a beneficiary that receives credit to an account that it uses or maintains at a Federal Reserve Bank as payment for a payment order accepted by a Federal Reserve Bank. Subpart C of this part also applies to Federal Reserve Banks that send or receive payment orders over the FedNow Service. For example, if a sender settles its activity over the FedNow Service in the account of a correspondent bank, the sender's Federal Reserve Bank would be a bank in the funds transfer chain, but the Federal Reserve Bank of the correspondent bank would not be a sender or receiving bank with respect to the payment order and would not be a party to the funds transfer. Other parties to a funds transfer sent through the FedNow Service are covered by this subpart to the same extent that this subpart would apply to them if this subpart were a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A that selected subpart C of this part as the governing law. (2) The scope of the applicability of a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A is specified in section 4A-501(b), and the scope of the choice of law provision is specified in section 4A-507(c). Under section 4A-507(c), a choice of law provision is binding on the participants in a funds-transfer system and certain other parties having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used for the funds transfer and of the choice of law provision. The Uniform Commercial Code provides that a person has notice of a fact when the person has actual knowledge of it, receives a notice or notification of it, or has reason to know that it exists from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question. (See UCC section 1-202.) However, under sections 4A-507(b) and 4A-507(d), a choice of law by agreement of the parties takes precedence over a choice of law made by funds-transfer system rule. (3) With respect to funds transfers sent through the FedNow Service, if originators and beneficiaries that are not in privity with a Federal Reserve Bank have the notice contemplated by Section 4A-507(c) or if those parties agree to be bound by subpart C of this part, subpart C of this part generally would apply to those remote parties. If remote parties to a funds transfer, a portion of which is sent through the FedNow Service, have expressly selected by agreement a law other than subpart C of this part under section 4A-507(b), subpart C of this part would not take precedence over the choice of law made by the agreement even though the remote parties had notice that the FedNow Service may be used and of the governing law. (See 4A-507(d).) In addition, subpart C of this part would not apply to a funds transfer sent through a funds-transfer system other than the FedNow Service, even though settlement for the funds transfer is made by means of a separate funds transfer through the FedNow Service. (4) Under section 4A-108, Article 4A does not apply to a funds transfer, any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) (15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq.). A funds transfer from a consumer originator or a funds transfer to a consumer beneficiary could be carried out through the FedNow Service and could potentially be subject to the EFTA and Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005) implementing it. If so, the funds transfer continues to also be governed by subpart C, except that, in the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of subpart C and the EFTA, the EFTA shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. (See also the commentary to section 210.41 in this appendix, Payment Order.) For example, a funds transfer may be initiated from a consumer's account at a depository institution, and the depository institution may execute that payment order by sending a conforming payment order to a Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service. If that transfer is subject to the EFTA, then where the consumer subsequently reports the transfer as an unauthorized electronic fund transfer to its depository institution and exercises the right to obtain reimbursement under the terms of the EFTA, the depository institution would be required to comply with the EFTA even if the institution does not have a right to reverse the payment order sent to the Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service under subpart C. (c) Operating Circulars. The Federal Reserve Banks issue Operating Circulars consistent with this subpart that contain additional provisions applicable to payment orders and other messages sent through the FedNow Service. Under section 4A-107, this Operating Circular supersedes inconsistent provisions of Article 4A, both as set forth in appendix A of this part and as enacted in any state. These Operating Circulars are not funds-transfer system rules, but, by their terms, they are binding on all parties covered by this subpart. (d) Government senders, receiving banks, and beneficiaries. This section clarifies that unless a statute of the United States provides otherwise, subpart C of this part applies to governmental entities. (e) Financial messaging standards. This paragraph makes clear that financial messaging standards, including the financial messaging components, elements, technical documentation, tags, and terminology used to implement those standards, do not confer or connote legal status or responsibilities. Instead, subpart C of this part and Federal Reserve Bank operating circulars govern the rights and obligations of parties to funds transfers sent through the FedNow Service as provided in 210.40(b). Thus, to the extent there is any inconsistency between a financial messaging standard adopted by the FedNow Service and subpart C of this part, subpart C of this part, including Article 4A as set forth in appendix A of this part, will prevail. In the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, for example, the term agent is used to refer to a variety of bank parties to a funds transfer (e.g., debtor agent, creditor agent, intermediary agent). Notwithstanding use of that term in the standard and in message tags, such banks are not the agents of any party to a funds transfer and owe no duty to any other party to such a funds transfer except as provided in subpart C of this part (including Article 4A) or by express agreement. The ISO 20022 financial messaging standard also permits information to be carried in a funds-transfer message regarding persons that are not parties to that funds transfer (e.g., ultimate debtor, ultimate creditor, initiating party) for regulatory, compliance, remittance, or other purposes. An ultimate debtor is not an originator as defined in Article 4A. The relationship between the ultimate debtor and the originator (what the ISO 20022 standard calls the debtor) is determined by law other than Article 4A. Article 4A defines many terms (e.g., beneficiary, intermediary bank, receiving bank, security procedure) used in this subpart. These terms are defined or listed in sections 4A-103 through 4A-105. These terms, such as the term bank (defined in section 4A-105(d)(2)), may differ from comparable terms in subpart A and subpart B of this part. As subpart C of this part incorporates consistent provisions of Article 4A, it incorporates these definitions unless these terms are expressly defined otherwise in subpart C of this part. This subpart modifies the definitions of five Article 4A terms: Beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, payment order, receiving bank, and sender. This subpart also defines terms not defined in Article 4A. Article 4A. Article 4A means the version of that article of the Uniform Commercial Code set forth in appendix A of this part. It does not refer to the law of any particular state unless the context indicates otherwise. Subject to the express provisions of this Subpart, this version of Article 4A is incorporated into this subpart and made federal law for transactions covered by this subpart. (See 210.40(b)(1) and accompanying commentary.) Because section 4A-105 refers to other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (e.g., definitions in article 1 of the UCC) these other provisions of the UCC, as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which is now also known as the Uniform Law Commission, and the American Law Institute, from time to time, are also incorporated in subpart C of this part. Beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, receiving bank, and sender. The definitions of beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, receiving bank, and sender in subpart C of this part differ from the definitions in sections 4A-103(a)(2)-(4). The subpart C Start Printed Page 31392definition clarifies that, for the purposes of subpart C of this part, these terms are limited to parties in a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service. For example, the parties to a funds transfer that is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service would be governed by subpart B of this part, and would not be a beneficiary, beneficiary's bank, receiving bank, or sender governed by subpart C. The definition of beneficiary's bank in subpart C further clarifies that where a Federal Reserve Bank functions as the beneficiary's bank, it need not be identified in the payment order as the beneficiary's bank and that a Federal Reserve Bank that receives a payment order as beneficiary is also the beneficiary's bank with respect to that payment order. The FedNow Service. The FedNow Service refers to the funds-transfer system owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks to support instant payments that is governed by this Subpart. The term does not refer to any particular computer, telecommunications facility, or funds transfer, but rather to the system as a whole. The FedNow Service does not include the Fedwire Funds Service or the system used for automated clearing house transfers. Payment Order. (1) The definition of payment order in subpart C of this part differs from the section 4A-103(a)(1) definition. The subpart C definition clarifies that, for the purposes of subpart C of this part, the term includes only instructions transmitted through the FedNow Service. For example, instructions transmitted through the Fedwire Funds Service would be governed by subpart B of this part, and not subpart C. Additionally, the subpart C definition provides that certain messages that are transmitted through the FedNow Service are not payment orders. Federal Reserve Banks and banks participating in the FedNow Service send various types of messages relating to payment orders or to other matters, through the FedNow Service, that are not intended to be payment orders. In some cases, messages sent through the FedNow Service, such as certain requests for payment, may be payment orders under Article 4A, but are not treated as payment orders under subpart C because they are not an instruction to a Federal Reserve Bank to pay or cause another bank to pay money. Under the subpart C definition, these messages are not payment orders governed by this subpart. The operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks may specify those messages that may be transmitted through the FedNow Service but that are not payment orders. (2) Subpart C, including its incorporation of Article 4A, governs a payment order even though the originator's or beneficiary's account may be a consumer account established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Under section 4A-108, Article 4A does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. That Act, and Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005) implementing it, may govern a transfer through the FedNow Service that is from a consumer originator or to a consumer beneficiary. In the event that a transfer through the FedNow Service is subject to the EFTA, the transfer continues to also be governed by this subpart, except that, in the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of subpart C and the EFTA, the EFTA shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. (See also 210.40(b) and accompanying commentary.) Thus, this subpart applies to all funds transfers through the FedNow Service even though some such transfers involve originators or beneficiaries that are consumers. Sender's settlement account, receiving bank's settlement account, and beneficiary's settlement account. A FedNow participant must designate an account on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank that the Federal Reserve Banks may use to settle the participant's activity over the FedNow Service. A FedNow participant may settle its activity over the FedNow Service in its master account. Alternatively, it may designate the account of a correspondent bank that the Federal Reserve Banks may use to settle activity through the service, subject to the correspondent bank's agreement to any such designation. (a) Reliance by a Federal Reserve Bank on number to identify intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank. Section 4A-208 provides that a receiving bank, such as a Federal Reserve Bank, may rely on the routing number of an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank specified in a payment order as identifying the appropriate intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank, even if the payment order identifies another bank by name, provided that the receiving bank does not know of the inconsistency. Under section 4A-208(b)(2), if the sender of the payment order is not a bank, a receiving bank may rely on the number only if the sender had notice before the receiving bank accepted the sender's order that the receiving bank might rely on the number. This section provides this notice to entities that are not banks, such as the Department of the Treasury, that send payment orders directly to a Federal Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service. (b) Reliance by a Federal Reserve Bank on number to identify beneficiary. Section 4A-207 provides that a beneficiary's bank, such as a Federal Reserve Bank, may rely on the number identifying a beneficiary, such as the beneficiary's account number, specified in a payment order as identifying the appropriate beneficiary, even if the payment order identifies another beneficiary by name, provided that the beneficiary's bank does not know of the inconsistency. Under section 4A-207(c)(2), if the originator is not a bank, an originator is not obliged to pay for a payment order if the originator did not have notice that the beneficiary's bank might rely on the identifying number and the person paid on the basis of the identifying number was not entitled to receive payment. This section of subpart C provides this notice to entities that are not banks, such as the Department of the Treasury, that are originators of payment orders sent directly by the originators to a Federal Reserve Bank through the FedNow Service, where that Federal Reserve Bank or another Federal Reserve Bank is the beneficiary's bank (see also section 4A-402(b), providing that a sender must pay a beneficiary's bank for a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank). (a) Payment of sender's obligation to a Federal Reserve Bank. When a sender sends a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts the payment order by issuing a conforming order executing the sender's payment order, under section 4A-402, the sender is indebted to the Federal Reserve Bank for the amount of the payment order. Section 4A-403 specifies the various methods by which a sender may settle the obligation under section 4A-402. With respect to a payment order sent through the FedNow Service, the obligation of a sender (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) is settled by a debit to the account of the sender at a Federal Reserve Bank. Section 210.43(a) provides that a sender, other than a Federal Reserve Bank, that maintains or uses a settlement account at a Federal Reserve Bank authorizes its Federal Reserve Bank to debit, or cause any other Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained to debit, that account, so that the Federal Reserve Bank can obtain payment for the payment order. (b) Overdrafts. (1) In some cases, debits to a sender's settlement account will create an overdraft in the settlement account. The Board and the Federal Reserve Banks have established policies concerning when a Federal Reserve Bank will permit a bank to incur an overdraft in its account at a Federal Reserve Bank. These policies do not give a bank or other sender a right to an overdraft in its account. Subpart C clarifies that a sender does not have a right to such an overdraft. If an overdraft arises, it becomes immediately due and payable at the earliest of the following times: The end of the FedNow funds-transfer business day; the time the Federal Reserve Bank in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice to the sender; or the time that the sender suspends payments or is closed by governmental action, such as the appointment of a receiver. In some cases, a Federal Reserve Bank extends its FedNow operations beyond the standard cut-off time for that FedNow funds-transfer business day. For the purposes of this section, unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve Bank making such an extension, an overdraft becomes due and payable at the end of the extended operating hours. An overdraft becomes due and payable prior to a Federal Reserve Bank's cut-off time if the Federal Reserve Bank deems itself insecure and gives notice to the sender. A Federal Reserve Bank that deems itself insecure may give such notice in accordance with the provisions on notice in section 1-202(d) of the UCC, in accordance with any other applicable law or agreement, or by any other reasonable means. An overdraft also becomes due and payable at the time that a bank is closed or suspends payments. For example, an overdraft Start Printed Page 31393becomes due and payable if a receiver is appointed for the bank or the bank is prevented from making payments by governmental order. The Federal Reserve Bank need not make demand on the sender for the overdraft to become due and payable. (2) A sender must cover any overdraft and any other obligation of the sender to the Federal Reserve Bank by the time the overdraft becomes due and payable. By sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank, the sender grants a security interest to the Federal Reserve Bank in all of the assets of the sender possessed or controlled by, or held for the account of, the Federal Reserve Bank in order to secure all obligations due or to become due to the Federal Reserve Bank. The security interest attaches when the overdraft, or other obligation of the sender to the Federal Reserve Bank, becomes due and payable. The security interest does not apply to assets held by the sender as custodian or trustee for the sender's customers or third parties. Once an overdraft is due and payable, a Federal Reserve Bank may exercise its right of set off, liquidate collateral, or take other similar action to satisfy the obligation the sender owes to the Federal Reserve Bank. (c) Review of payment orders. (1) Under section 4A-204, a receiving bank is required to refund the principal amount of an unauthorized payment order that the sender was not obliged to pay, together with interest on the refundable amount calculated from the date that the receiving bank received payment to the date of the refund. The sender is not entitled to compensation in the form of interest if the sender fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized and to notify the receiving bank within a reasonable time after the sender receives a notice that the payment order was accepted or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order. Similarly, under section 4A-304, if a sender of a payment order that was erroneously executed does not notify the bank receiving the payment order within a reasonable time, the bank is not liable to the sender for compensation in the form of interest on any amount refundable to the sender. Section 210.43(c) establishes 60 calendar days as the reasonable period of time for the purposes of these provisions of Article 4A. (2) Section 4A-505 provides that in order for a customer to assert a claim objecting to a debit to its account by a receiving bank, the customer must notify the receiving bank of its objection within one year after the customer received notification reasonably identifying the payment order. Subpart C of this part does not vary this one-year claim preclusion period. (b) Funds availability. (1) Section 4A-209(b) provides that a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order at the earliest of certain specified events, including when the bank receives payment for the entire amount of the order from the sender (see section 4A-209(b)(2)). Section 4A-404(a) provides that if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, it is obliged to pay the amount of a payment order to the beneficiary on the payment date unless acceptance of the payment order occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank. Section 4A-405(a) provides that if a beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary by crediting an account of the beneficiary on its own books, payment of the bank's obligation under Section 4A-404(a) occurs when and to the extent (i) the bank notifies the beneficiary that it may withdraw the amount of the credit, (ii) the bank lawfully applies the credit to a debt of the beneficiary, or (iii) funds with respect to the payment order are otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank. (2) Section 210.44(b)(1) provides that if a FedNow participant that is the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, it must pay the beneficiary by credit to the beneficiary's account in accordance with section 4A-405(a) of Article 4A, and it must do so immediately after its acceptance of the payment order. This section further clarifies that the provisions of the Expedited Funds Availability Act (12 U.S.C. 4002(a)) and its implementing regulation, Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229), also govern. Regulation CC provides that funds received by a bank by an electronic payment shall be available for withdrawal not later than the business day after the banking day on which such funds are received. (12 CFR 229.10(b).) Because Subpart C of this part requires funds to be made available on a more prompt basis than the availability requirements of the Expedited Funds Availability Act and Regulation CC, that act and Regulation CC do not preempt or invalidate subpart C. For example, if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order through the FedNow Service at 10 a.m. but does not make funds available to the beneficiary until 5p.m., the bank has failed to satisfy its obligations under subpart C of this part even if it has satisfied its obligations under Regulation CC. (3) Section 210.44(b)(2) clarifies that the obligation for the beneficiary's bank to provide immediate funds availability to the beneficiary under section 210.44(b)(1), and any Operating Circular issued in accordance with subpart C, should not be construed as creating any rights that the beneficiary or any party other than a Federal Reserve Bank may assert against the beneficiary's bank, or affect any liability of the beneficiary's bank to the beneficiary or any party other than a Federal Reserve Bank under Article 4A or other law. In the example in this paragraph (b), where the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order through the FedNow Service at 10 a.m. but does not make funds available to the beneficiary until 5 p.m., the bank has failed to satisfy its obligations under 210.44(b)(1) but the beneficiary would not have a claim or right to assert against the bank under that provision. (4) Section 210.46(a) provides that payment by a Federal Reserve Bank to a receiving bank occurs when the receiving bank's settlement account is credited or when the payment order is sent by the Federal Reserve Bank to the receiving bank, whichever is earlier, and would ordinarily be considered acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank under section 4A-209(b). Section 210.44(b)(3) provides that notwithstanding section 4A-209(b), in certain circumstances a beneficiary's bank is not deemed to accept a payment order at such time as it receives payment from its Federal Reserve Bank. Specifically, where the beneficiary's bank has reasonable cause to believe that the beneficiary is not entitled or permitted to receive payment and the beneficiary's bank notifies its Federal Reserve Bank that it requires additional time to determine whether to accept the payment order, this section provides that for purposes of subpart C and Article 4A, the beneficiary's bank does not accept the payment order even if it has received payment for the entire amount of the order from its Federal Reserve Bank as provided in 210.46. For example, if the beneficiary's bank has reasonable cause to believe that making funds available to the beneficiary may violate applicable U.S. sanctions, the beneficiary's bank may notify its Federal Reserve Bank that it requires additional time to determine whether to accept the payment order, including to investigate if the beneficiary is subject to applicable sanctions; in the event the beneficiary's bank gives such notice, the beneficiary's bank would not be deemed to have accepted the payment order at the time it receives payment from its Federal Reserve Bank. (a) Rejection. (1) A sender must make arrangements with its Federal Reserve Bank before it can send payment orders to the Federal Reserve Bank. Federal Reserve Banks reserve the right to reject or impose conditions on the acceptance of payment orders for any reason. For example, a Federal Reserve Bank might reject or impose conditions on accepting a payment order where a sender does not have sufficient funds in its settlement account with the Federal Reserve Bank to cover the amount of the sender's payment order and other obligations of the sender due or to become due to the Federal Reserve Bank. As a further example, a Federal Reserve Bank may reject a payment order that is not successfully processed within time limits established by the Federal Reserve Banks. A Federal Reserve Bank may require a sender to execute a written agreement concerning security procedures or other matters before the sender may send payment orders to the Federal Reserve Bank. (b) Selection of an intermediary bank. (1) Under section 4A-302, if a receiving bank (other than a beneficiary's bank), such as a Federal Reserve Bank, accepts a payment order, it must issue a payment order that complies with the sender's order. The sender's order may include instructions concerning an intermediary bank to be used that must be followed by a receiving bank (see section 4A-302(a)(1)). If the sender does not designate any intermediary bank in its payment order, the receiving bank may select an intermediary bank through which the sender's payment order can be expeditiously issued to the beneficiary's bank so long as the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in selecting the intermediary bank (see section 4A-302(b)).Start Printed Page 31394 (2) This section provides that in an interdistrict transfer, a Federal Reserve Bank is authorized and directed to select another Federal Reserve Bank as an intermediary bank. A sender may not instruct a Federal Reserve Bank to use a particular intermediary bank or to use its discretion to select an intermediary bank other than a Federal Reserve Bank or an intermediary bank designated by the sender. In addition, a sender may not send a payment order through the FedNow Service that instructs a Federal Reserve Bank to use a funds-transfer system or means of transmission other than the FedNow Service, unless the sender and the Federal Reserve Bank agree in writing to the use of that funds-transfer system or means of transmission. (c) Execution date and payment date. (1) Under 4A-301(b), the execution date of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order. Under section 4A-401, the payment date of a payment order is the day on which the amount of the order is payable to the beneficiary by the beneficiary's bank. The execution date and the payment date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received (see sections 4A-301(b) and 4A-401). Section 4A-106, provides for the time that a payment order is received, including in the event that a receiving bank fixes a cut-off time for the receipt and processing of payment orders. If the bank receives a payment order after its cut-off time, the bank may treat the payment order as received at the opening of the next funds-transfer business day (see section 4A-106(a)). (2) The FedNow Service is designed to be an instant value transfer system through which funds may be transferred from the originator to the beneficiary on the same funds-transfer business day. This section provides that a sender may not send a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that specifies an execution date or payment date later than the day on which the payment order is issued, unless the sender of the order and the Federal Reserve Bank agree in writing to the arrangement. (a) Payment to a receiving bank. (1) Under section 4A-402, when a Federal Reserve Bank executes a sender's payment order by issuing a conforming order to a receiving bank that accepts the payment order, the Federal Reserve Bank must pay the receiving bank the amount of the payment order. Section 210.44(a) authorizes a Federal Reserve Bank to make the payment by crediting, or causing any other Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained to credit, the settlement account of the receiving bank. Section 210.46(a) provides that the payment occurs when the receiving bank's settlement account is credited or when the payment order is sent by the Federal Reserve Bank to the receiving bank, whichever is earlier. Ordinarily, payment will occur during the FedNow funds-transfer business day a short time after the payment order is received. This credit is final and irrevocable when made and constitutes final settlement under section 4A-403. Payment does not waive a Federal Reserve Bank's right of recovery under the applicable law of mistake and restitution (see 210.47(c)), affect a Federal Reserve Bank's right to apply the funds to any obligation due or to become due to the Federal Reserve Bank, or affect legal process or claims by third parties on the funds. (2) This section on final payment does not apply to settlement for payment orders between Federal Reserve Banks. These payment orders are settled by other means. (b) Payment to a beneficiary. Section 210.46(b) specifies when a Federal Reserve Bank makes payment to a beneficiary for which it is the beneficiary's bank. As in the case of payment to a receiving bank, this payment occurs at the earlier of the time that the Federal Reserve Bank credits the beneficiary's settlement account or sends notice of the credit to the beneficiary, and is final and irrevocable when made. (a) Damages. (1) Under section 4A-305(d), damages for failure of a receiving bank to execute a payment order that it was obligated to execute by express agreement are limited to expenses in the transaction and incidental expenses and interest and do not include additional damages, including consequential damages, unless they are provided for in an express written agreement of the receiving bank. This section clarifies that in connection with the handling of payment orders, Federal Reserve Banks may not agree to be liable for consequential damages under this provision and shall not be liable for damages other than those that may be due under Article 4A to parties governed by this subpart. Any agreement in conflict with these provisions would not be effective, because it would be in violation of subpart C. (2) This section does not affect the ability of other parties to a funds transfer to agree to be liable for consequential damages, the liability of a Federal Reserve Bank under section 4A-404 (relating to obligation of beneficiary's bank to pay and give notice to beneficiary), or the liability to parties governed by subpart C for claims not based on the handling of a payment order under subpart C. (b) Payment of compensation. (1) Under Article 4A, a Federal Reserve Bank may be required to pay compensation in the form of interest to another party in connection with its handling of a funds transfer. For example, payment of compensation in the form of interest is required in certain situations pursuant to sections 4A-204 (relating to refund of payment and duty of customer to report with respect to unauthorized payment order), 4A-209 (relating to acceptance of payment order), 4A-210 (relating to rejection of payment order), 4A-304 (relating to duty of sender to report erroneously executed payment order), 4A-305 (relating to liability for late or improper execution or failure to execute a payment order), 4A-402 (relating to obligation of sender to pay receiving bank), and 4A-404 (relating to obligation of beneficiary's bank to pay and give notice to beneficiary). (2) Section 210.47(b) requires Federal Reserve Banks to provide compensation through payment in the form of interest. Under section 4A-506(a), the amount of such interest may be determined by agreement between the sender and receiving bank or by funds-transfer system rule. If there is no such agreement, under section 4A-506(b), the amount of interest is based on the federal funds rate. Similarly, compensation in the form of interest will be paid to government senders, receiving banks, or beneficiaries described in 210.40(d) if they are entitled to interest under subpart C. A Federal Reserve Bank may also, in its discretion, pay compensation in the form of interest directly to a remote party to a transfer through the FedNow Service that is entitled to interest, rather than providing compensation to its sender or receiving bank. (3) If a sender or receiving bank that received a payment of compensation is not the party entitled to compensation under Article 4A, the sender or receiving bank must pass the benefit of the compensation payment made to it to the party that is entitled to compensation. The benefit may be passed on either in the form of a direct payment of interest or in the form of a compensating balance, if the party entitled to interest agrees to accept the other form of compensation. In the latter case, the value of the compensating balance must be at least equivalent to the value of the interest payment that otherwise would have been provided. (c) Nonwaiver of right of recovery. Several sections of Article 4A allow a party to a funds transfer to make a claim pursuant to the applicable law of mistake and restitution. Nothing in subpart C of this part or any Operating Circular issued in accordance with subpart C of this part waives any such claim by a Federal Reserve Bank. A Federal Reserve Bank, however, may waive such a claim by express written agreement in order to settle litigation or for other purposes. 13. Add Appendix A of part 210 to read as follows: This Article may be cited as Uniform Commercial CodeFunds Transfers.

(a) The time of receipt of a payment order or communication canceling or amending a payment order is determined by the rules applicable to receipt of a notice stated in Section 1-201(27). A receiving bank may fix a cut-off time or times on a funds-transfer business day for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications canceling or amending payment orders. Different cut-off times may apply to payment orders, cancellations, or amendments, or to different categories of payment orders, cancellations, or amendments. A cut-off time may apply to senders generally or different cut-off times may apply to different senders or categories of payment orders. If a payment order or communication canceling or amending a payment order is received after the close of a funds-transfer business day or after the appropriate cut-off time on a funds-transfer business day, the receiving bank may treat the payment order or communication as received at the opening of the next funds-transfer business day. (b) If this Article refers to an execution date or payment date or states a day on which a receiving bank is required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a funds-transfer business day, the next day that is a funds-transfer business day is treated as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this Article. Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks supersede any inconsistent provision of this Article to the extent of the inconsistency. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), this Article does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (Title XX, Public Law 95-630, 92 Stat. 3728, 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq.) as amended from time to time. (b) This Article applies to a funds transfer that is a remittance transfer as defined in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1693o-1) as amended from time to time, unless the remittance transfer is an electronic fund transfer as defined in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1693a) as amended from time to time. (c) In a funds transfer to which this Article applies, in the event of an inconsistency between an applicable provision of this Article and an applicable provision of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the provision of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act governs to the extent of the inconsistency. Security procedure means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or communication amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure. (a) A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency. (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the Start Printed Page 31396customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i) the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a written agreement with the customer or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted. (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer. (d) The term sender in this Article includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (a) of this section, or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection (b) of this section. (e) This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders. (f) Except as provided in this section and in section 4A-203(a)(1), rights and obligations arising under this section or section 4A-203 may not be varied by agreement. (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under section 4A-202(a), an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order of the customer pursuant to section 4A-202(b), the following rules apply: (1) By express written agreement, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order. (2) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person (i) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure, or (ii) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault. Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like. (b) This section applies to amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders. (a) If a receiving bank accepts a payment order issued in the name of its customer as sender which is (i) not authorized and not effective as the order of the customer under section 4A-202, or (ii) not enforceable, in whole or in part, against the customer under section 4A-203, the bank shall refund any payment of the payment order received from the customer to the extent the bank is not entitled to enforce payment and shall pay interest on the refundable amount calculated from the date the bank received payment to the date of the refund. However, the customer is not entitled to interest from the bank on the amount to be refunded if the customer fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized by the customer and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding 90 days after the date the customer received notification from the bank that the order was accepted or that the customer's account was debited with respect to the order The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the customer on account of a failure by the customer to give notification as stated in this section. (b) Reasonable time under subsection (a) of this section may be fixed by agreement as stated in section 1-204(1), but the obligation of a receiving bank to refund payment as stated in subsection (a) may not otherwise be varied by agreement. (a) If an accepted payment order was transmitted pursuant to a security procedure for the detection of error and the payment order (i) erroneously instructed payment to a beneficiary not intended by the sender, (ii) erroneously instructed payment in an amount greater than the amount intended by the sender, or (iii) was an erroneously transmitted duplicate of a payment order previously sent by the sender, the following rules apply: (1) If the sender proves that the sender or a person acting on behalf of the sender pursuant to section 4A-206 complied with the security procedure and that the error would have been detected if the receiving bank had also complied, the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent stated in this paragraphs (2) and (3). (2) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of an erroneous payment order described in clause (i) or (iii) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order and the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. (3) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of a payment order described in clause (ii) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent the amount received by the beneficiary is greater than the amount intended by the sender. In that case, the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary the excess amount received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. (b) If (i) the sender of an erroneous payment order described in subsection (a) is not obliged to pay all or part of the order, and (ii) the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care, on the basis of information available to the sender, to discover the error with respect to the order and to advise the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time, not exceeding 90 days, after the bank's notification was received by the sender. If the bank proves that the sender failed to perform that duty, the sender is liable to the bank for the loss the bank proves it incurred as a result of the failure, but the liability of the sender may not exceed the amount of the sender's order. (c) This section applies to amendments to payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders. (a) If a payment order addressed to a receiving bank is transmitted to a funds-transfer system or other third-party communication system for transmittal to the bank, the system is deemed to be an agent of the sender for the purpose of transmitting the payment order to the bank. If there is a discrepancy between the terms of the payment order transmitted to the system and the terms of the payment order transmitted by the system to the bank, the terms of the payment order of the sender are those transmitted by the system. This section does not apply to a funds-transfer system of the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) This section applies to cancellations and amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders. (a) Subject to subsection (b), if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur. (b) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply: (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not Start Printed Page 31397determine whether the name and number refer to the same person. (2) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur. (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) is accepted, (ii) the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (b)(1), the following rules apply: (1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order. (2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates. (d) In a case governed by subsection (b)(1), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as follows: (1) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (c), the originator has the right to recover. (2) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank has the right to recover. (a) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number. (1) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank. (2) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order. (b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons. (1) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order. (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (b)(1), as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates. (3) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person. (4) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in section 4A-302(a)(1). (a) Subject to subsection (d), a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order when it executes the order. (b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d), a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order at the earliest of the following times: (1) When the bank (i) pays the beneficiary as stated in section 4A-405(a) or 4A-405(b), or (ii) notifies the beneficiary of receipt of the order or that the account of the beneficiary has been credited with respect to the order unless the notice indicates that the bank is rejecting the order or that funds with respect to the order may not be withdrawn or used until receipt of payment from the sender of the order; (2) When the bank receives payment of the entire amount of the sender's order pursuant to section 4A-403(a)(1) or 4A-403(a)(2); or (3) The opening of the next funds-transfer business day of the bank following the payment date of the order if, at that time, the amount of the sender's order is fully covered by a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender or the bank has otherwise received full payment from the sender, unless the order was rejected before that time or is rejected within (i) one hour after that time, or (ii) one hour after the opening of the next business day of the sender following the payment date if that time is later. If notice of rejection is received by the sender after the payment date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the payment date to the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not accepted, counting that day as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest payable is reduced accordingly. (c) Acceptance of a payment order cannot occur before the order is received by the receiving bank. Acceptance does not occur under subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) if the beneficiary of the payment order does not have an account with the receiving bank, the account has been closed, or the receiving bank is not permitted by law to receive credits for the beneficiary's account. (d) A payment order issued to the originator's bank cannot be accepted until the payment date if the bank is the beneficiary's bank, or the execution date if the bank is not the beneficiary's bank. If the originator's bank executes the originator's payment order before the execution date or pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order before the payment date and the payment order is subsequently canceled pursuant to section 4A-211(b), the bank may recover from the beneficiary any payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. (a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing. A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means. (b) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to section 4A-211(d) or the day the sender receives Start Printed Page 31398notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly. (c) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments. (d) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order. (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally, electronically, or in writing. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment. (b) Subject to subsection (a), a communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order. (c) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank. (1) With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made. (2) With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order (i) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender, (ii) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator, or (iii) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator. If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. (d) An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order. (e) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time. (f) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment. (g) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order. (h) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (c)(2) of this section. If a receiving bank fails to accept a payment order that it is obliged by express agreement to accept, the bank is liable for breach of the agreement to the extent provided in the agreement or in this Article, but does not otherwise have any duty to accept a payment order or, before acceptance, to take any action, or refrain from taking action, with respect to the order except as provided in this Article or by express agreement. Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in section 4A-209, and liability is limited to that provided in this Article. A receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts, or of any other party to the funds transfer, and the bank owes no duty to any party to the funds transfer except as provided in this Article or by express agreement. (a) A payment order is executed by the receiving bank when it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by the bank. A payment order received by the beneficiary's bank can be accepted but cannot be executed. (b) Execution date of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order. The execution date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received. If the sender's instruction states a payment date, the execution date is the payment date or an earlier date on which execution is reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date. (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) through (d), if the receiving bank accepts a payment order pursuant to section 4A-209(a), the bank has the following obligations in executing the order: (1) The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning (i) any intermediary bank or funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer, or (ii) the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer. If the originator's bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator. An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts. (2) If the sender's instruction states that the funds transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious means, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most expeditious available means, and to instruct any intermediary bank accordingly. If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon thereafter as is feasible. (b) Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving bank executing a payment order may (i) use any funds-transfer system if use of that system is reasonable in the circumstances, and (ii) issue a payment order to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank. A receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith, determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer. (c) Unless subsection (a)(2) applies or the receiving bank is otherwise instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by transmitting its payment order by first class mail or by any means reasonable in the circumstances. If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the sender's order by transmitting its payment order by the means stated or by any means as expeditious as the means stated. (d) Unless instructed by the sender, (i) the receiving bank may not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment order in an Start Printed Page 31399amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of the charges, and (ii) may not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain payment of its charges in the same manner. (a) A receiving bank that (i) executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount greater than the amount of the sender's order, or (ii) issues a payment order in execution of the sender's order and then issues a duplicate order, is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 4A-402(c) if that subsection is otherwise satisfied. The bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the erroneous order the excess payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. (b) A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 4A-402(c) if (i) that subsection is otherwise satisfied and (ii) the bank corrects its mistake by issuing an additional payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the sender's order. If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order. This subsection does not apply if the receiving bank executes the sender's payment order by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order for the purpose of obtaining payment of its charges for services and expenses pursuant to instruction of the sender. (c) If a receiving bank executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order to a beneficiary different from the beneficiary of the sender's order and the funds transfer is completed on the basis of that error, the sender of the payment order that was erroneously executed and all previous senders in the funds transfer are not obliged to pay the payment orders they issued. The issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the order the payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. If the sender of a payment order that is erroneously executed as stated in section 4A-303 receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was executed or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care to determine, on the basis of information available to the sender, that the order was erroneously executed and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding 90 days after the notification from the bank was received by the sender. If the sender fails to perform that duty, the bank is not obliged to pay interest on any amount refundable to the sender under section 4A-402(d) for the period before the bank learns of the execution error. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the sender on account of a failure by the sender to perform the duty stated in this section. (a) If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of section 4A-302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable. (b) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of section 4A-302 results in (i) noncompletion of the funds transfer, (ii) failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or (iii) issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (a), resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable. (c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b), damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank. (d) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the transaction and for incidential expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank, but are not otherwise recoverable. (e) Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (a) or (b) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a claim is made for breach of an agreement under subsection (d) and the agreement does not provide for damages, reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (d) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. (f) Except as stated in this section, the liability of a receiving bank under subsections (a) and (b) of this section may not be varied by agreement. Payment date of a payment order means the day on which the amount of the order is payable to the beneficiary by the beneficiary's bank. The payment date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received by the beneficiary's bank and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received by the beneficiary's bank. (a) This section is subject to sections 4A-205 and 4A-207. (b) With respect to a payment order issued to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the order, but payment is not due until the payment date of the order. (c) This subsection is subject to subsection (e) and to section 4A-303. With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order. Payment by the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order. The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order. (d) If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged to pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to refund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay. Except as provided in sections 4A-204 and 4A-304, interest is payable on the refundable amount from the date of payment. (e) If a funds transfer is not completed as stated in subsection (c) and an intermediary bank is obliged to refund payment as stated in subsection (d) but is unable to do so because not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments, a sender in the funds transfer that executed a payment order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in section 4A-302(a)(1), to route the funds transfer through that intermediary bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the payment order that it accepted. The first sender in the funds transfer that issued an instruction requiring routing through that intermediary bank is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund as stated in subsection (d) of this section . (f) The right of the sender of a payment order to be excused from the obligation to pay the order as stated in this subsection (c) or to receive refund under subsection (d) may not be varied by agreement. (a) Payment of the sender's obligation under section 4A-402 to pay the receiving bank occurs as follows: (1) If the sender is a bank, payment occurs when the receiving bank receives final settlement of the obligation through a Federal Reserve Bank or through a funds-transfer system. (2) If the sender is a bank and the sender (i) credited an account of the receiving bank with the sender, or (ii) caused an account of the receiving bank in another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or, if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable and the receiving bank learns of that fact.Start Printed Page 31400 (3) If the receiving bank debits an account of the sender with the receiving bank, payment occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable credit balance in the account. (b) If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of the system. The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system. The aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system. The aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second sentence of this subsection has been exercised. (c) If two banks transmit payment orders to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations of each bank to the other under section 4A-402 will be made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by one bank shall be set off against the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank. To the extent of the setoff, each bank has made payment to the other. (d) In a case not covered by paragraph (a) of this section, the time when payment of the sender's obligation under section 4A-402(b) or 4A-402(c) occurs is governed by applicable principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied. (a) Subject to sections 4A-211(e), 4A-405(d), and 4A-405(e), if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, the bank is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order. Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day. If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment. (b) If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date. If the payment order does not instruct payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary only if notice is required by the order. Notice may be given by first class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank. No other damages are recoverable. Reasonable attorney's fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. (c) The right of a beneficiary to receive payment and damages as stated in subsection (a) may not be varied by agreement or a funds-transfer system rule. The right of a beneficiary to be notified as stated in subsection (b) of this section may be varied by agreement of the beneficiary or by a funds-transfer system rule if the beneficiary is notified of the rule before initiation of the funds transfer. (a) If the beneficiary's bank credits an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, payment of the bank's obligation under section 4A-404(a) occurs when and to the extent (i) the beneficiary is notified of the right to withdraw the credit, (ii) the bank lawfully applies the credit to a debt of the beneficiary, or (iii) funds with respect to the order are otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank. (b) If the beneficiary's bank does not credit an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, the time when payment of the bank's obligation under section 4A-404(a) occurs is governed by principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied. (c) Except as stated in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, if the beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary of a payment order under a condition to payment or agreement of the beneficiary giving the bank the right to recover payment from the beneficiary if the bank does not receive payment of the order, the condition to payment or agreement is not enforceable. (d) A funds-transfer system rule may provide that payments made to beneficiaries of funds transfer made through the system are provisional until receipt of payment by the beneficiary's bank of the payment order it accepted. A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if (i) the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated, (ii) the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank and the originator's bank agreed to be bound by the rule, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted. If the beneficiary is obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under section 4A-406. (e) This paragraph applies to a funds transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system that (i) nets obligations-multilaterally among participants, and (ii) has in effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of one or more participants that do not meet their settlement obligations. If the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer, (i) the acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance, (ii) the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary, (iii) no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under section 4A-406, and (iv) subject to section 4A-402(e), each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under section 4A-402(c) because the funds transfer has not been completed. (a) Subject to sections 4A-211(e), 4A-405(d), and 4A-405(e), the originator of a funds transfer pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order (i) at the time a payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary is accepted by the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer and (ii) in an amount equal to the amount of the order *40813 accepted by the beneficiary's bank, but not more than the amount of the originator's order. (b) If payment under paragraph (a) of this section is made to satisfy an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result from payment to the beneficiary of the same amount in money, unless (i) the payment under subsection (a) was made by a means prohibited by the contract of the beneficiary with respect to the obligation, (ii) the beneficiary, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of receipt of the order by the beneficiary's bank, notified the originator of the beneficiary's refusal of the payment, (iii) funds with respect to the order were not withdrawn by the beneficiary or applied to a debt of the beneficiary, and (iv) the beneficiary would suffer a loss that could reasonably have been avoided if payment had been made by a means complying with the contract. If payment by the originator does not result in discharge under this section, the originator is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to receive payment from the beneficiary's bank under section 4A-404(a). (c) For the purpose of determining whether discharge of an obligation occurs under paragraph (b) of this section, if the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the originator's payment order less charges of one or more receiving banks in the funds transfer, payment to the beneficiary is deemed to be in the amount of the originator's order unless upon demand by the Start Printed Page 31401beneficiary the originator does not pay the beneficiary the amount of the deducted charges. (d) Rights of the originator or of the beneficiary of a funds transfer under this section may be varied only by agreement of the originator and the beneficiary. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the rights and obligations of a party to a funds transfer may be varied by agreement of the affected party. (b) Funds-transfer system rule means a rule of an association of banks (i) governing transmission of payment orders by means of a funds-transfer system of the association or rights and obligations with respect to those orders, or (ii) to the extent the rule governs rights and obligations between banks that are parties to a funds transfer in which a Federal Reserve Bank, acting as an intermediary bank, sends a payment order to the beneficiary's bank. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a funds-transfer system rule governing rights and obligations between participating banks using the system may be effective even if the rule conflicts with this Article and indirectly affects another party to the funds transfer who does not consent to the rule. A funds-transfer system rule may also govern rights and obligations of parties other than participating banks using the system to the extent stated in sections 4A-404(c), 4A-405(d), and 4A-507(c). (a) As used in this section, creditor process means levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration, or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant with respect to an account. (b) This subsection applies to creditor process with respect to an authorized account of the sender of a payment order if the creditor process is served on the receiving bank. For the purpose of determining rights with respect to the creditor process, if the receiving bank accepts the payment order the balance in the authorized account is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment order to the extent the bank did not otherwise receive payment of the order, unless the creditor process is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank accepts the payment order. (c) If a beneficiary's bank has received a payment order for payment to the beneficiary's account in the bank, the following rules apply: (1) The bank may credit the beneficiary's account. The amount credited may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank or may be applied to satisfy creditor process served on the bank with respect to the account. (2) The bank may credit the beneficiary's account and allow withdrawal of the amount credited unless creditor process with respect to the account is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act to prevent withdrawal. (3) If creditor process with respect to the beneficiary's account has been served and the bank has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the bank may not reject the payment order except for a reason unrelated to the service of process. (d) Creditor process with respect to a payment by the originator to the beneficiary pursuant to a funds transfer may be served only on the beneficiary's bank with respect to the debt owned by that bank to the beneficiary. Any other bank served with the creditor process is not obliged to act with respect to the process. For proper cause and in compliance with applicable law, a court may restrain (i) a person from issuing a payment order to initiate a funds transfer, (ii) an originator's bank from executing the payment order of the originator, or (iii) the beneficiary's bank from releasing funds to the beneficiary or the beneficiary from withdrawing the funds. A court may not otherwise restrain a person from issuing a payment order, paying or receiving payment of a payment order, or otherwise acting with respect to a funds transfer. (a) If a receiving bank has received more than one payment order of the sender or one or more payment orders and other items that are payable from the sender's account, the bank may charge the sender's account with respect to the various orders and items in any sequence. (b) In determining whether a credit to an account has been withdrawn by the holder of the account or applied to a debt of the holder of the account, credits first made to the account are first withdrawn or applied. If a receiving bank has received payment from its customer with respect to a payment order issued in the name of the customer as sender and accepted by the bank, and the customer received notification reasonably identifying the order, the customer is precluded from asserting that the bank is not entitled to retain the payment unless the customer notifies the bank of the customer's objection to the payment within one year after the notification was received by the customer. (a) If, under this Article, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined (i) by agreement of the sender and receiving bank, or (ii) by a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system. (b) If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection (a), the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable Federal Funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable Federal Funds rate is the average of the Federal Funds rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360. The Federal Funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank. (a) The following rules apply unless the affected parties otherwise agree or paragraph (c) of this section applies: (1) The rights and obligations between the sender of a payment order and the receiving bank are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the receiving bank is located. (2) The rights and obligations between the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located. (3) The issue of when payment is made pursuant to a funds transfer by the originator to the beneficiary is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located. (b) If the parties described in each subsection of paragraph (a) of this section have made an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between each other, the law of that jurisdiction governs those rights and obligations, whether or not the payment order or the funds transfer bears a reasonable relation to that jurisdiction. (c) A funds-transfer system rule may select the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern (i) rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system, or (ii) the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out by means of the system. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (i) is binding on participating banks. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (ii) is binding on the originator, other sender, or a receiving bank having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system when the originator, other sender, or receiving bank issued or accepted a payment order. The beneficiary of a funds transfer is bound by the choice of law if, when the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary has notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system. The law of a jurisdiction selected pursuant to this subsection may govern, whether or not that law bears a reasonable relation to the matter in issue. (d) In the event of inconsistency between an agreement under paragraph (b) of this section and a choice-of-law rule under Start Printed Page 31402paragraph (c) of this section, the agreement under paragraph (b) prevails. (e) If a funds transfer is made by use of more than one funds-transfer system and there is inconsistency between choice-of-law rules of the systems, the matter in issue is governed by the law of the selected jurisdiction that has the most significant relationship to the matter in issue. By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Ann Misback, Secretary of the Board. 1. See Federal Reserve Actions To Support Interbank Settlement of Faster Payments, Request for Comments, 84 FR 39297 (Aug. 9, 2019). 2. Service Details on Federal Reserve Actions To Support Interbank Settlement of Instant Payments, 85 FR 48522 (Aug. 11, 2020). 3. UCC Article 4A has been amended once, in 2012. The 2012 amendments, as approved by the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which is now also known as the Uniform Law Commission, were necessary to retain the coverage of non-consumer remittance transfers by UCC Article 4A in light of revisions to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Those statutory changes brought certain non-consumer remittance-related fund transfers under the scope of the EFTA and thus, absent amendment, would have been explicitly carved out from coverage by UCC Article 4A. Regulation J was also amended in 2012 to similarly clarify that its provisions continue to apply to a Fedwire Funds transfer even if the funds transfer also meets the definition of remittance transfer under the EFTA. Collection of Checks and Other Items by Federal Reserve Banks and Funds Transfers Through Fedwire: Elimination of As-of Adjustments and Other Clarifications, 77 FR 21854 (Apr. 12, 2012). 4. This example is only for illustrative purposes. Aspects of the arrangement would be different, for example, if either of the banks were to use an agent, service provider, or correspondent bank. 5. This does not prevent FedNow participants from implementing procedures to resolve erroneous payments, or impede the ability of the receiving bank to initiate a new transfer to return funds in certain circumstances. 6. As a point of comparison, under the Faster Payments Effectiveness Criteria adopted by the Faster Payments Task Force in 2015, a payment solution would be considered very effective in satisfying the criterion of fast availability of good funds to the payee if funds are available to the payee within one minute from payment initiation. The Faster Payments Task Force was a broad and inclusive group of payment industry stakeholders convened by the Federal Reserve to collaboratively identify and evaluate alternative approaches to implementing safe, ubiquitous, faster payments capabilities in the United States. The Faster Payments Effectiveness Criteria is available at https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/fptf-payment-criteria.pdf. 7. Federal Reserve Regulatory Service, 7-145.2. 8.

<TITLE>Credibility Capital Small-Business Loans: 2020 Review - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Credibility Capital offers short-term business loans for small-business owners with good credit and an established business. 6.99 - 24.99% 650 Competitive rates among online lenders. No prepayment penalty. Extra monthly payments can save interest cost. Requires high minimum credit score and revenue. Requires business lien and may require personal guarantee. Not available in Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota or Vermont. Credibility Capital, a New York-based online lender founded in 2013, offers low-risk borrowers access to short-term business loans. Credibility Capital is a good fit for: Strong credit borrowers: It's attractive to good-credit borrowers who may fall just short of qualifying for traditional financing. Small businesses looking for growth opportunities: According to Brett Baris, Credibility Capital CEO and co-founder, average loan size was around $175,000 in 2019, and businesses typically use the money for expansion and refinancing high APRs. Underwriting flexibility: Credibility Capital takes a holistic view of a businesss finances, meaning it doesnt always execute hard cutoffs for certain business metrics, Baris says. If a company shows strong performance in a specific area, for instance, that may compensate for low credit score or revenue. No prepayment fee: If you take out a term loan but find yourself financially stable sooner than you thought, you can pay off the loan faster without incurring additional fees. Paying your loan back early can help cut down on how much you pay in interest, lowering the overall cost of borrowing.  MORE: Compare low-interest business loans Automatic monthly payments: Each month, youll pay a portion of the loan via an ACH transfer. The loan is fully amortizing, meaning each payment will consist of interest and principal. This ensures the loan will be paid off at the end of the loan term. Not for bad-credit borrowers: While Credibility Capital doesnt have an official minimum credit requirement, typical borrowers have at least a 650 personal credit score. Borrowers also cant have had a personal or commercial bankruptcy within the past five years. Our underwriting is, in a sense, a little more traditional than some other folks in our industry, Baris says. Not for long-term financing: Term loans max out at three years, so if youre looking for financing you can use in the near and distant future, youre better off looking into long-term financing from SmartBiz, for instance, which provides Small Business Administration loans.  MORE: Find options for short-term business loans Requires a UCC-1 filing and possibly a personal guarantee: Credibility Capital loans are secured by a UCC-1 filing, which essentially means youre putting up your business as collateral. Though the company doesnt place a lien on a specific item (real estate, equipment, etc.), the filing means it has a stake in your assets. Additionally, if you own 25% or more of your business, you will also need a personal guarantee for the loan. In this case, your personal assets could be at risk. Ifyoud like to compare loan options, NerdWallet has a list of small-business loans that are best for business owners. All of our recommendations are based on the lenders market scope and track record and on the needs of business owners, as well as rates and other factors, so you can make the right financing decision. Credibility Capital is a New York-based online lender that was founded in 2013. Since 2019, the company has been accredited by the Better Business Bureau, where it has an A+ rating. Credibility Capital performs a soft credit inquiry to check your credit score, which does not impact your credit score. The lender performs a hard pull only if youre approved for financing and move forward with the loan. Jackie Zimmerman is a former small-business and personal-loans writer for NerdWallet.

You borrow a lump of cash upfront for a specific purpose and repay the loan over a set period of time with fixed, equal payments. Requirements, rates and speed of funding vary between banks and online lenders. Term loans range in size from $2,000 to $5 million, with annual percentage rates ranging from 6% to 99%. Banks offer low rates on term loans, but typically carry stricter requirements such as a strong personal credit score and high annual revenue and take longer to fund. Bank term loans typically have long repayment terms of up to 10 years. Online lenders offer speed and convenience, but typically carry higher costs. They also tend to have looser qualifications than banks. In addition, you can get short-term loans with repayment terms between three months and three years from online business lenders. Both banks and online lenders provideSmall Business Administration loans, which are guaranteed by the federal agency. This type of term loan provides up to $5 million and carries repayment terms of up to 25 years, depending on what the money is for. SBA loans also have some of the lowest APRs, making them a good option for long-term financing. Like mortgages and car loans, term loans typically follow an amortization schedule. This means most of your payment goes toward paying interest at the beginning of the loan, and more toward principal near the end. Term loans can usually be repaid early to save on interest, although lenders may charge a prepayment penalty. Term loan example: On a $100,000 term loan with a five-year repayment period at 20% APR, youd make fixed monthly payments of $2,649 and pay total interest and fees of $58,963.

<TITLE>6 Best Banks for Small-Business Loans in 2021 - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Banks offer multiple types of business loans, but getting approved can be difficult. Banks are best for small-business loans if your company has been around more than a year and doesnt need cash fast. Approvals can take months and are far from a sure thing even with good credit. Banks approve only about 13% of business loan applications, according to the latest data from the Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index. That means the right bank for you not only offers the type of business loan you need, but also funds enough loans to make financing possible. Here are the best banks for small-business loans based on their commercial and industrial lending volume and product offerings, as well as alternative options to consider. Bank of America had the most commercial and industrial loans among banks as of September 2020 surpassing the next closest lender by almost $100 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Bank of America business loans are a good choice if you value rewards. By meeting certain account requirements, you can qualify for interest rate discounts, no fees on wire transfers and other benefits. Bank of America may also make sense for veterans and service members, as it offers them a 25% discount on loan administration or origination fees. Bank of America is currently not processing new applications for unsecured business loans as it prioritizes the Paycheck Protection Program.  MORE: Compare unsecured business loans Term loans. Bank of America offers both fixed-rate secured and unsecured term loans. Its secured loan requires greater annual revenue: $250,000 versus $100,000 for the unsecured option. But it offers higher borrowing limits up to $250,000 and a potentially lower interest rate. Both business loans require at least two years in business and can have repayment terms of up to five years, which is less than other banks may offer. Business lines of credit. Bank of America also offers secured and unsecured business lines of credit, with the same revenue requirements as its term loans. The secured line of credit comes with additional borrowing power starting at $25,000 compared with $10,000 for the unsecured option. There is no set borrowing maximum. Both have revolving terms, meaning you use the money as needed, that renew annually. SBA loans. Bank of America is a preferred Small Business Administration lender, but it is less active in issuing SBA loans. For example, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank lend more 7(a) loans the most common type of SBA funding. Other business loans. Bank of America offers business auto loans starting at $10,000. The bank also has commercial real estate loans and equipment loans, which both start at $25,000. Chase offers products for small-business owners, including checking accountsandcredit cards.Chase business loans include: Term loans. Chase offers fixed- and adjustable-rate loans starting at $5,000, which is less than lenders like Bank of America or PNC Bank. Repayment terms can last from one to seven years. Business lines of credit. Chase has business and commercial lines of credit. Its business line of credit provides $10,000 to $500,000 in funding on a renewable five-year revolving term. The commercial line is $500,000 and up, with one- to two-year terms that may be renewed. SBA loans. Chase is an SBA-preferred lender and funds multiple types of SBA loans. That includes SBA Express loans and credit lines, which offer faster funding of up to $350,000. Other business loans. Chase has multiple equipment loans with fixed or variable rates, terms up to seven years (or up to 75% of the equipments estimated useful life) and up to 10% included for soft costs such as shipping and installation. Loans start at $10,000. Its commercial real estate loans are also fixed or variable and start at $50,000, with terms of up to seven or 10 years. Citibank may be better known among entrepreneurs for its small-business credit cards. But the bank also offers business loans though it has fewer products than other lenders. You might prefer that simplicity, but it also means you may want to consider other lenders if Citi doesnt advertise the kind of loan you want. Term loans. Citibanks term loan ranges from $5,000 to $3 million. Interest rates are fixed, terms last up to seven years and loans require a personal guarantee. Citi doesn't offer an equipment loan, but term loans can be used for this purpose. Business lines of credit. Citibank offers two business lines of credit, with amounts ranging from $10,000 to $3 million. Both lines come with variable interest rates and revolving terms and require a personal guarantee. Wells Fargo discontinued its term loan products, including Equipment Express loans, in 2021. However, the bank still offersother types of small-business financing and multiple types of lines of credit. Wells Fargos lending maximums are less than some banks, so consider other options if you have collateral and need more than $500,000 in financing. Business lines of credit. Wells Fargo has three different lines of credit one unsecured and two secured by collateral ranging from $5,000 to $500,000. Credit lines of up to $100,000 have variable rates and are revolving. Those greater than $100,000 have a one-year term. Youll typically need at least $2 million to $5 million in annual sales to qualify for Wells Fargos most generous business line of credit. Fees vary by product. SBA loans. Wells Fargo is one of the most active SBA loan lenders. As of September 2020, it had approved more than $114 million in SBA 7(a) loans in the 2020 fiscal year the most among traditional national banks. Other business loans. Wells Fargo offers semi truck financing, commercial real estate purchase loans and equity financing, as well as specific products for starting or buying a medical practice. PNCs business loans are best for more mature businesses. You generally need to have been in business for at least three years to qualify, which is longer than other banks may require. Term loans. PNC offers $20,000 to $100,000 for unsecured term loans and $100,001 to $3 million for loans secured by collateral. Unsecured loans come with a fixed interest rate and terms of up to five years, whereas rates on secured loans can be fixed or variable and terms can last up to seven years. Business lines of credit. The amounts for PNCs lines of credit mirror the banks term loans, with unsecured options ranging from $20,000 to $100,000 and secured options from $100,001 to $3 million. Both have variable interest rates and revolving terms. The unsecured line has an annual fee of $175, while the secured line charges 0.25% of the committed line amount. SBA loans. PNC is a preferred SBA lender, but the bank is less active than others issuing these loans. Other business loans. PNC business auto loans range from $10,000 to $250,000 with repayment terms up to six years. The banks commercial real estate loans come with fixed or variable interest rates, repayment terms up to 10 years and financing amounts from $100,001 to $3 million. U.S. Bank has fewer locations than other brick-and-mortar banks, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo. But if theres a branch near you, U.S. Bank may be a good choice for startups with collateral, as you may be able to qualify for an SBA loan with less than a year in business. Term loans. U.S. Bank offers fixed-rate, secured term loans of up to $1 million. It doesn't have an unsecured business loan. If you need fast access to working capital, the bank has a quicker version of its term loan product. The Quick Loan has a lower borrowing maximum ($250,000) but a faster application process. Its best for companies in business for at least two years. Business lines of credit. U.S. Banks business line of credit also goes up to $1 million and has an interest-only payment option. The banks revolving line of credit, called CashFlow Manager, goes up to $250,000 and is for companies that have been in business for at least two years. That product has a $150 annual fee if the line or credit is less than $50,000. SBA loans. U.S. Bank may be another good choice if youre in the market for an SBA loan. As of September 2020, it had approved the second-most 7(a) loan applications in the 2020 fiscal year. Other business loans. U.S. Bank offers equipment loans of up to $500,000, and soft costs of up to 25% can be included. The bank has fixed- and variable-rate commercial real estate loans of up to $10 million with five-, 10- or 15-year repayment terms, with amortizations up to 25 years. Due to the pandemic and market conditions, business loan approvals at banks were down more than 50% in December 2020 compared with the same time the previous year, according to Biz2Credit. To be able to still get a business loan from a bank, youll likely need the following: An existing relationship. Most banks require you to have at least a business checking account at their institution. While you can simply open an account at some banks to meet this qualification, others want a longer-term relationship. For example, you need an account with Wells Fargo for at least 12 months to receive some kinds of financing. Good credit. Youll likely need a personal credit score in at least the 700s. Potential deal-breakers could include too much debt, too many open accounts or negative marks like late payments, loan defaults and bankruptcies. The bank will check your business credit score for similar red flags. Strong revenue.When you apply for a small-business loan, the bank will look to see whether your business is in good shape and has enough revenue to support how much you want to borrow. For example, Bank of Americas unsecured business loans require at least $100,000 in annual revenue; its secured options increase that number to $250,000. Enough time in business. Two years under the same ownership is the standard. But there are exceptions in both directions. For example, some U.S. Bank lending products are available if youve been in business for six months, whereas PNC Bank generally requires at least three years of operations for you to qualify. Collateral. You dont necessarily need to put up business collateral like commercial property or equipment to get a bank loan. Some banks offer both unsecured and secured business loans. But the bank may fund larger amounts for secured loans, while also providing longer terms and lower interest rates to make payments more affordable. If you cant get a business loan from a big bank, consider these alternatives: Community banks. Business loan applicants report higher approval rates with smaller banks than big-name financial institutions, as well as greater overall satisfaction, according to a 2020 Federal Reserve survey. However, the number of community banks is dwindling, and a local bank may lack benefits you want like online loan management or multiple locations. Online lenders. Online business loans come with faster funding and higher approval rates than bank loans. Some online lenders even specialize in small-business loans. For example, as of September 2020, Live Oak Bank is the most-active SBA 7(a) lender by loan volume. Online lenders are also less likely to require traditional collateral and may provide funding for newer businesses. But the trade-off will likely be higher costs than a traditional bank offers. Microlenders. Nonprofit organizations offer microloans, and these can be a good choice for startups or small businesses that need working capital but cant qualify for a bank business loan. Microloans are typically less than $50,000 and come with short repayment terms. Their costs will also likely be higher than a bank business loan.

<TITLE>Is Invoice Factoring Right for Your Business? - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Invoice factoring turns unpaid invoices into fast cash to help finance short-term needs for your small business. As a small-business owner, you can turn your unpaid customer invoices into fast cash with invoice factoring.This financing option is best for businesses owners whose customers are other businesses. Because these customers typically don't pay for goods or services right away, invoice factoring can provide immediate cash for business owners to keep paying employees or other expenses. Heres what you need to know about invoice factoring. Technically, invoice factoring is not a loan. Rather, you sell your invoices at a discount to a factoring company in exchange for a lump sum of cash. The factoring company then owns the invoices and gets paid when it collects from your customers, typically in 30 to 90 days. Lets say you own a hardware store and sell goods to another business, creating a $10,000 invoice.Your customer agrees to pay off its invoice in 30 days, but you need the cash next week to pay your employees. Youve got a cash shortfall. You could turn to a traditional bank for a loan, but it likely would require stellar personal credit plus collateral, a physical asset such as real estate that the lender could sellif you default. Or maybe you qualify but cant wait several months for the loan to close. So you turn to an invoice factoring company, and it agrees to buy your invoice for $9,700 in cash $10,000 minus a 3% factoring fee ($300). The invoice factoring company advances 85% of the invoice (or $8,245) within a few days. The factoring company then collects the invoice when its due and providesthe remaining balance owed to you ($1,455). Invoice value $10,000 Fee (3%) $300 Initial advance (85% of invoice value after fee) $8,245 Remaining advance (12%) $1,455 Total received $9,700 The factoring fee, also known as the discount rate, can run from 1% to 5%, depending on the invoice amount, your sales volume, your customers creditworthiness and whether the factor is "recourse" or "nonrecourse." The factor type refers to who is ultimately responsible for an invoice that goes unpaid your company or the factoring company. If the contract is a recourse factor and the customer doesnt pay, you may have to buy back the unpaid receivable from the factoring company or replace it with a more current receivable of equal or greater value. If its a nonrecourse factor, youre under no obligation to repay or replace the unpaid receivables, but youll likely be charged a higher transaction fee because the factoring company takes on the added risk of not getting its money back. Fast cash: Invoice factoring can provide immediate working capital to help cover a funding gap caused by slow-paying customers. Improved cash flow: You can keep loyal customers on longer payment terms but still improve your cash flow to help you grow your business. Easier approval: Invoice factoring provides financing to companies that might not be able to get capital from other sources, such as a traditional bank, because of a lack of collateral, poor personal credit or a limited operating history. Typically, factoring companies care only about the value of the invoices you're looking to factor and the creditworthiness of your customers. No collateral required: Invoice factoring is unsecured financing, which means it doesn't require collateral anasset such as real estate or inventory that the lender can seize if you fail to pay. High cost: The service can be expensive. You also have to watch out for hidden fees, such as application fees, processing fees for each invoice you finance, credit check fees or late fees if your client is past due on a payment. Late payments can trigger an increase in your annual percentage rate, the annual cost of borrowing money with all fees and interest included. Not for every business: Invoice factoring is best for businesses that work with other businesses because transactions involve invoices. So businesses that sell or work directly with consumers won't qualify for this option. Loss of direct control: Because the invoice factoring company may collect on the invoices directly, you need to make sure it's ethical and fair when dealing with your customers. Customers bad credit or weak finances could derail your financing: The factoring company may need to verify the creditworthiness of your customers. If the customers have a history of late or missed payments, or if the business has weak revenue, you may not be approved for the financing. The factoring company expects to get paid back, just like other types of lenders. No guarantee of collection: Theres no certainty the invoice factoring company will successfully collect on your unpaid invoices. If it's a recourse factor, the factoring company may require you to buy back the unpaid invoice or replace it with one of equal or greater value. Invoice financing is a bit different from factoring. Instead of selling your invoices to a factoring company, you use the invoices as collateral to get a cash advance and you remain responsible for collecting payment on the invoices.

Work with our lending specialists to get smart answers to all your small business questions. Best of all, its completely free. Best Of Online lenders offer working capital loans to finance short-term business expenses. Working capital loans are short-term financing that can help your business cover operational costs, such as rent, payroll or restocking inventory. The loans carry short repayment terms and are not typically used for long-term investments, such as real estate or equipment. Banks offer the lowest annual percentage rates on working capital loans, but they also have tougher credit score and revenue requirements than online lenders. If you dont qualify for a bank loan or if you need fast working capital, you can turn to online lenders for small-business loans. with Fundera by Nerdwallet Our pick for Working capital for everyday needs with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 9.00 - 99.00% 600 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: Our pick for Working capital for large purchases with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 6.99 - 24.99% 650 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: Our pick for Working capital for unpaid customer invoices Companies that work in the business-to-business sector will face gaps in cash flow.

Banks and credit unions are options for established businesses with collateral and strong credit, while online lenders may provide options for borrowers with spotty credit histories. Online or alternative lenders will typically charge higher APRs than banks and credit unions. Working capital financing may be a smart move when your business needs cash to cover day-to-day operational expenses. The loans can provide a lifeline for seasonal businesses that experience a dip in sales, like landscapers, ski resorts and retailers. This is a short-term loan to solve a temporary slowdown, so it isn't the best solution for business expansion or financing a long-term investment. If you need to borrow for those reasons, consider a long-term business loan instead. Term loans: While term loans are commonly used for financing an expansion, they can also be used for short-term working capital. Term loans provide a sum of cash upfront that is repaid over a set period of time with fixed, equal payments. Business lines of credit: A line of credit provides more flexibility than term loans, as you get access to funds up to a credit limit and only pay interest on what youve borrowed. You can draw and repay funds as often as youd like, as long as you make payments and dont exceed your limit. SBA loans: These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration and issued through participating banks, credit unions and online lenders. SBA loans provide up to $5 million for working capital, expansion or equipment purchases. Invoice factoring: If you have customers with unpaid invoices, this type of financing lets you turn the invoices into fast working capital. The factoring company buys your invoices for an upfront payment (minus a fee), and it gets paid when it collects from your customer.

<TITLE>Does Chime Offer a Business Bank Account? - NerdWallet</TITLE>

We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. You cant get a business bank account from Chime, but these other online options may offer similar features. Chime is an online financial company that doesn't offer business bank accounts. Instead, it specializes in personal spending and savings accounts. NerdWallet recommends keeping personal and business checking accounts separate. But if you were interested in a Chime business bank account for benefits like good interest rates and low fees, the alternatives below may offer your small business similar features. The right bank account for you will come down to your unique business needs and budget. But if you want to open an online business checking account, the following options may be a good fit instead of Chime. Chime accounts have no monthly fees or overdraft charges. For a similar low-cost option, NBKC offers a free business checking account with no minimum deposit plus budget-conscious perks like unlimited fee-free transactions and no fees for insufficient funds. On the other hand, NBKC does charge a high fee ($45) to send or receive international wires; a different provider may be a better choice if your business relies on such services. NBKC business checking accounts also dont earn interest.  MORE: NBKC business checking review If youd prefer an interest-bearing business checking account, consider BlueVine. Account holders with BlueVine Business Checking earn 1.00% interest on balances that dont go over $100,000 a rate that exceeds the 0.50% Chime offers on its savings accounts, as of this writing. BlueVine also keeps business checking costs low, with no monthly fees or nonsufficient funds fees. And similar to Chime, you can deposit cash at over 90,000 physical locations via a partnership with the third-party service Green Dot. Just keep in mind that there is a $4.95 fee per deposit.  MORE: BlueVine Business Checking review at Radius, Member FDIC For a Chime business bank account alternative with broad ATM access, business owners might consider Radius Tailored Checking. Like Chime, Radius participates in the MoneyPass ATM network, which has more than 37,000 fee-free ATMs nationwide. But Radius also partners with the SUM ATM network, offering you even more options. Account holders receive unlimited transactions and ATM access without incurring fees. This includes the ability to make cash deposits. Radius Tailored Checking charges a $10 monthly fee, though this can be waived if your account balance is $5,000 or more. Opening an account requires a $100 minimum deposit.  MORE: Radius Tailored Checking review While Chime customers may be comfortable banking online, Capital One Spark Business Basic Checking combines features more common with online-only operations like unlimited transactions with a traditional brick-and-mortar presence. Capital One Spark Business Basic Checking supports cash deposits and offers no-fee ATM access. However, it's available in only eight states and Washington, D.C., and youll need to visit a branch to sign up. Accounts also require a $250 minimum opening deposit and charge a $15 monthly fee, which can be waived if a balance of at least $2,000 is maintained.

<TITLE>The Economics of How to Run a Haunted House - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us.

Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Halloween attractions across the country pull in thousands of guests each year. Learn how to run a haunted house. Visiting a haunted house is a time-honored tradition during Halloween season. The months of September, October, and even into November are prime time for getting scared half to death by people in elaborate, grizzly costumes and terrifying props. Its also (assuming youre visiting a haunted house for entertainment purposes and not just some random abandoned mansion) a business. Haunted house industry publication Hauntworld estimates that there are over 4,000 paid Halloween attractions across the country, pulling in thousands of guests each seasonand making haunted houses a billion-dollar industry.By now, you might be wonderinghow to run a haunted house is it a viable business? Suffice to say, the allure of starting a haunted house business and raking in big bucks for what they might assume is just 6 to 10 weeks of work is appealing to many people. But they tend not to recognize the enormous effort that goes into creating an immersive horror experience that brings customers back year after year. Billy Messina, on the other hand, has co-owned and operated Netherworld, a highly regarded haunted attraction (Hauntworld rated it the second-scariest attraction in the country in 2016) right outside of Atlanta in Norcross, Georgia, for 21 years now. He says its common for people to overestimate the profits and underestimate the work. It can be intoxicating for people, he says. Its not like opening a lemonade stand. That being said, Messina has some tips for how to run a haunted house. Messina teamed up with his business partner to start their own haunted house, Netherworld, after an attempt to bring a version of an already-established haunted house chain to Atlanta fell through. Previously, Messina worked as a makeup effects artist and special prop maker in the film industry, while partner Ben Armstrong had a background in TV production and a shared interest in haunted houses. I had worked at local haunted houses prior to that, just to help out, Messina says. Haunted houses are just so much fun. Id go and help do makeup, build a prop, decorate a room for them, just for fun. After deciding to get their own venture off the ground, Messina and Armstrong stuck with Netherworld through its difficult first yearsall the while working other jobs and dedicating their free time to making their dream a reality. Maybe a smarter person would have quit after a couple of years, but we love haunted houses, we love Halloween, and we just thought it would work. And eventually, people would come in the numbers that made this a wise decision, Messina says. Much like any business for an entrepreneur, I think the key ingredient is a love for what youre doing. If you love what you do, its not going to feel like work. Now, Netherworld pulls in an estimated 75,000 visitors a year and is one of the biggest names in the haunted house industry. That allows them to sell tickets for prices that range from $23 to $35 (depending on the night and the attraction) or as much as $55 for a speed pass. Still wondering how to run a haunted house? The next tip is critical. Location is everything for a business, but thats especially true when it comes to haunted houses. When Netherworld was just starting out, terrestrial radio and print advertising were still kings, and directions couldnt be overly long or complicated. An easy-to-find location was critical. That remains true today despite the fact that many people have smartphones for directionskeep in mind there are other considerations besides physical location when you're wondering how to run a haunted house. When youre looking for a haunted house location, you cant just do it in a house, says Messina, You need to be up to fire code, have enough exits per number of linear feet, and you cant have just stairs because its not ADA compliant. Netherworld actually just went through the process of finding a new locationafter 21 years in Norcross, theyll be leaving their long-term leased space for their own building next season. We worked with a real estate agent familiar with our product. We gave them the parameters: at least 50,000 square feet but as much as 100,000 square feet, and at least 400 parking spots. Wed want it to have sprinklers [another requirement], though thats not a deal-breaker, we can put sprinklers in, says Messina. We looked at warehouses, manufacturing plants, some beautiful buildingsbut we had to figure out where to compromise. Another set of considerations is whether to lease or buy your location and what to do with the space in the months that you wont be scaring the wits out of visitors. It depends what level youre trying to go for. Its hard to get a short-term lease and put on a quality show. We have a long-term lease on our buildingwe pay rent on it all year long, says Messina. We dont have any income the rest of the year, but thats our choice because we want our show to be the best it can be every year. When we asked Messina what he would advise newcomers who are wondering how to run a haunted househe was adamant about public safety. Its important to reach out to your local fire marshal right away, tell him what you plan to do. Reach out to your local police force as well. Safety is absolutely paramount, says Messina. People have a vision and they want to create it, only to find out a week before theyre supposed to open that, they had a fire inspection and theyre not going to be able to open," he adds. "All of your dreams and hopes wont matter if you cant open. Public safety is incredibly important. It could be something minor you could fix, like a couple more exit signs, or it could be major, like a sprinkler system. And you should know that before you buy that building. So, not only is safety important from the perspective of being a decent human being and a good business ownerits important because other people are paid to consider the safety of your haunted house as well, and theyll have no qualms about keeping you shuttered if you cant show you can keep visitors safe. Running a big haunted house requires a lot of people to help keep things going: Messina says Netherworld has close to 400 people on payroll that are capable of working, though not all at the same time. About 120 or so people a night on average that work the haunted house, he says. During the season we also have police officers, security people, people in operations who put out signage and traffic cones, customer service people. Theres a lot of folks working for the same goal but focused on their specific tasks, and if that task isnt attended to, it affects the big picture. One thing you should know about how to run a haunted househaunted houses are a highly seasonal business, many of your employees will be temporary part-timers. That doesnt mean you shouldnt invest heavily in finding those who are passionate about the business as well, and keep them engaged, even in the offseason. You have to make it a rewarding experience for your employees, even though its only a month, Messina says. At a haunted house, you have the added challenge of trying to retain individuals even though its only a part-time job, you have to do right by your people. We work all year long with our employees, take them on movie outings and trainings. Additionally, he adds, another 12 to 20 people work quasi-full-time or on a more year-round basis. Thats not including people that we contract out to, when we want something made. We have 15 or so people who work all year long, anything from carpentry to costuming to painters to makeup artists. All told, Netherworld employs 10 makeup artists for each performance, the 120-plus performers can take up to an hour to suit up each night, and over 100 gallons of fake blood and other effects materials are used each season, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. You can source your costumes and props from outside sources, but Messina says Netherworld makes (or alters) over 90% of their costumes, which helps put Netherworld over the top when it comes to scaring people. We have people that pretty much all year are working on things, says Messina. They look a certain way, and you have to complete the picture. If you have this incredible mask, and then these goofy gloves and sneakers you bought from the store, thats not going to fly. That dedication is, in part, why people become repeat customers to Netherworld. We never want people to say, I don't want to go there, I went there last year. Every year its different, says Messina. We do keep elements people like, but after a few years we may change it up, to keep things fresh. We change the path, we change the theme, we change the story. Before we shut down for any given year, were already working on the next year. How can we improve on what were doing? Netherworld is one of the first results that Google serves you when you search for haunted houses, and thats no accident: Years of developing a stellar reputation and multiple press hits on everything from the AJC to the "Today Show" help immensely. But what should you do if youre just starting off and want to get the word out? (Few things sound as depressing as an empty haunted house.) We do all the traditional methods of advertising, like radio and billboards, and we do digital as well, says Messina. But every market is different. I could tell you exactly what we do here, and if you take it to another market, its completely different. You have to kind of feel it out. There are lots of avenues these days that are inexpensive to free to get you started, which is a great advantage for startups now. Dont go into the haunted house business expecting to make, as Messina puts it, a trillion dollars. Even the most successful haunted houses arent quite that profitable. But if you can't stop wondering how to run a haunted house and love the Halloween season and have a knack for scaring peoplewith elaborate costumes, or horrifying stories, or psychological manipulation (a good jump scare is great, but a tense, subtle scare is even creepier)then delving into this highly seasonal, high-risk, high-reward business might be for you.

An LLP is an unincorporated business owned and run by multiple people whose assets are protected. In its simplest form, a partnership is just two or more people getting together to own and run a business. But sometimes simplest doesnt mean right. If you and your partners are lawyers and doctors, two professions at high risk for malpractice lawsuits, a limited liability partnership, or LLP, may suit your needs. Thats because a basic partnership doesnt protect its owners personal assets against anyone demanding payment from the business. An LLP could be the solution to protecting yourself and the other partners. Or at least itll get you part of the way there. An LLP is an unincorporated business owned and run by multiple people, all of whom share ownership and management responsibilities. These multiple partners enjoy limited personal liability for the businesss debts and the actions of the other partners. This is crucial because, despite their efforts to do their jobs the right way, professionals may get sued when their clients arent happy with the outcome of their work. LLPs are commonly associated with businesses with licensed professionals, such as attorneys and accountants. Say youre a litigator and your clients disagree with your legal strategy, then lose their court case. They could sue you. Youre a doctor, and one of your patients gets seriously injured and dies under your care. Malpractice suit. Malpractice cases can be costly. As a partner in a law firm or doctors practice, you have some control over your own risk for a lawsuitbut little control over that of other partners. An LLP insulates your personal assets from others actions and the actions of the partnerships employees. That said, limited liability has limits. Each partner in an LLP remains personally liable for his or her own professional activities. Note that an LLP is not the same as a limited partnership; theyre two different business structures. All partners have limited personal liability.As a partner in an LLP, youre liable only for your own actions and those of the people you directly supervise, not the actions of the other partners or the LLP as a whole. In other words, if the LLP gets sued, your assets, including your home and car, arent at stake. Its a good employee motivator.LLPs can have many partners and frequently add new ones. The prospect of one day becoming a partner and gaining partial ownership of the business can be motivating for junior employees. They require less paperwork than LLCs and corporations.To form an LLP, you need to register with your state, pay a filing fee and create a partnership agreement. You dont need to create articles of incorporation and a board of directors, as with limited liability companies and corporations. Regulations vary by state. Every state has slightly different laws regarding LLP registration, which can make it confusing to decide where and how to form one. For example, in some states, including California and New York, you can only form an LLP if youre a certain type of licensed professional such as an attorney, an architect, an accountant or a physician. Pricey insurance policies for partners and the LLP.Since partners are responsible for their own liability, they must each carry individual malpractice insurance. For some medical specialties in some states, premiums have been known to exceed $100,000 per year. The LLP itself also needs insurance; in Massachusetts, for example, LLPs must carry liability insurance for minimum per-claim and aggregate amounts. Decide where to register: The requirements for forming a limited liability partnership vary by state, and some states offer more advantages than others. You can find information about specific state filing requirements at the Small Business Administration. If youre still unsure about where to register your LLP, you can consult an attorney to talk about what state is best for your business based on state business laws and tax codes. Register with your chosen state: To form an LLP, you must register with a state agency usually the secretary of states office and pay a filing fee, which varies by state. For example, in California, it costs $70 to register an LLP, plus a $15 service fee. In New York, the filing fee is $200. When you fill out the registration application, youll have to include your companys name. Many states require that you include limited liability partnership or LLP in the name. Get an employer identification number: You should get an EIN,a nine-digit number assigned to businesses for tax purposes. The IRS requires any business operating as a partnership to have one. Create a partnership agreement: An LLP agreement is a legal document that details the terms of your partnership. The agreement should outline the roles of each of the partners, how profits and losses will be divided, how partners can leave the LLP and how the partnership can be dissolved. You can create this document yourself using an online template or hire an attorney to help you create one. Get the proper licenses and permits for your business: Youll need certain licenses and permits to operate legally, depending on your state, locality and industry. Use theSBA's tool to find links to the relevant paperwork youll need. Publish a notice in a local newspaper: Some states require LLPs to publish a newspaper notice to alert the public of their businesss registration. For example, in New York, LLPs must publish a notice in two newspapers and pay a $50 fee to submit a certificate of publication to the state.

Kabbage was acquired by American Express Co. last year. For similar financing, consider Kabbage competitors. Alternative lender Kabbage offers fast access to working capital. Kabbage is a good small-business loan option for borrowers who: Dont have perfect personal credit: While underwriting your loan, Kabbage focuses on less traditional information like banking, accounting and e-commerce data. That makes it a good fit for business owners with rocky credit histories. Need cash fast: With an online application that can be completed in minutes, you can be approved for a line of credit and funded within a few days, at most. Prefer a short repayment period: Kabbage offers loans of up to $150,000 with repayment terms of six, 12 or 18 months.

Kabbage is a good option for business owners who cant get approved for a cheaper loan because of bad credit.

Six-month term: 0.25% to 3.50%. 12-month term: 0.25% to 2.75%. 18-month term: 0.25% to 2.50%. Like Kabbage, online lender OnDeck offers fast access to financing and has an easy application process.

And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free.

The cost of 2Checkout will ultimately depend on which of the three plans you choose. 2Checkout operates on a flat-rate pricing structure with the majority of standard payment methods costing the same flat rate per transaction. Some localized payments though, like Boleto Bancario and Kombini, have separate pricing points. 2Checkouts first plan, 2Sell, costs 3.5% plus 35 cents per transaction. The next plan, 2Subscribe, costs 4.5% plus 45 cents per transaction, and the final plan, 2Monetize, costs $6.0% plus 60 cents per transaction. If your business has a high sales volume, you can talk to the 2Checkout sales team about a custom-priced enterprise solution. These costs, however, are only 2Checkoutscredit card processing fees meaning theyre the charges you incur to process payments with 2Checkout. In specific countries, there is an added 2% fee to accept payments from international shoppers. Other than these transactional fees, 2Checkout does not charge a monthly subscription fee. It also doesnt charge fees for fraud protection or recurring payments. There are a few places where you will face additional fees when using 2Checkout. First, youll have to pay fees for chargebacks. 2Checkout hasfixed or threshold-based chargeback feesdepending on your service agreement with them. Furthermore, if you need advanced onboarding support or purchase one of the 2Checkout add-ons, youll have to pay the associated costs for those services. 2Checkout does not specify these costs on its website youll have to contact its sales team for more information. 2Checkout allows merchants to accept a variety of different methods and currencies. 2Checkout also gives you multiple ways to integrate its solution with your online store from hosted shopping carts to customizable APIs to third-partye-commerce platformintegrations depending on what works best for your business. In addition to its payment processing options, 2Checkout offers a vast feature set of e-commerce tools to not only help businesses improve their authorization rates and revenue but also maximize the growth and success of their operations. If you want to expand your online business across borders, 2Checkout provides you with the payment tools to do so. It allows you to accept different payment methods and currencies and also multiple checkout languages. Additionally, if you work with 2Checkout as your merchant of record, it will help you handle VAT taxes and international compliance. Furthermore, its flat-rate pricing structure across countries makes using its service simpler if youre doing business around the world. Although there is a 2% fee for certain countries to accept payments from customers outside your country, 23 countries are excluded from this charge, including the United States. There are many 2Checkout reviews across the internet, including a substantial amount of customers who are extremely dissatisfied with their service. However, there are also users who have had a positive experience with thisonline payment processor. In these reviews, customers say that its easy to integrate 2Checkout with their e-commerce store, the checkouts are straightforward for customers and the interface is generally user-friendly. Additionally, positive reviews often mention the variety of payment acceptance options and e-commerce tools, the flexibility of the platform and the international reach of 2Checkout. Although 2Checkout offers simple, flat-rate pricing that covers multiple payment methods across borders, when you compare its service to payment processing competitors on the market, its rates seem high. As an example,Square feesare 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction for e-commerce stores, compared to the 3.5% plus 35 cents for 2Checkouts 2Sell plan. Additionally, like 2Checkout, many other processors lack monthly, compliance and other fees, but generally, these payment processing options have lower transaction fees. There is an abundance of negative 2Checkout reviews online, which can be concerning. The majority of these negative reviews focus on a few points: the holding of funds, accounts being canceled or rejected and customer service regarding service issues. Unfortunately, funds holding and account cancellations often with little or no notice is a common problem with payment service providers. Although these providers can give you relatively quick access to payment processing, they also reserve the right to review your account and take action if they determine you to be a high-risk merchant. Occurrences like frequent chargebacks, fraudulent transactions and unusual sales volume are just a few of the reasons why a provider like 2Checkout might decide to hold your funds or terminate your account altogether. This does not mean that the negative customer reviews are unfounded. To prevent these types of issues, its best to thoroughly review2Checkouts sales guidelines, as well as any merchant or service agreement that you receive. It is perhaps more worrisome that many of these 2Checkout reviews from users report customer service issues when they try to reach out regarding their account and funds. Essentially, customers say that despite numerous attempts to talk to 2Checkout support about their account problems, theyve received no response or inadequate assistance. With all of the payment processing options available to your business, youll want to explore 2Checkout alternatives before making a final decision. Here are two worth considering: Perhaps one of the most recognizable names in payment processing,Stripeoffers a variety of payment options and is known for its customizable development tools. Like 2Checkout, Stripe allows you to accept multiple payment methods and currencies and create an integrated solution that works best for your business. With Stripe, you can develop your own payment form, use its embeddable checkout or integrate using Stripe API. Stripe also includes business operations tools and offers its own add-ons as well as third-party integration options. Stripe charges 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction and does not require a subscription or other additional fees. Although not as specified for e-commerce and digital products as 2Checkout, Stripe offers many of the same functions at a cheaper per-transaction cost.  MORE: NerdWallet's best small-business apps For an option that offers payment processing with a dedicated merchant account (which Stripe does not), you might considerBraintree. Braintree gives your e-commerce business the ability to accept multiple payment methods from major credit cards to mobile wallets. Braintree also operates in over 130 currencies and over 45 countries. Additionally, whether for desktop or mobile, Braintree has customizable checkout options. You can use its drop-in UI or tailor your own experience with its custom UI offering. Braintree offers third-party integrations with top e-commerce providers, as well as other business tools. With a Braintree account, you have access to its fraud and reporting tools, recurring billing and integration support. Braintree, like Stripe, charges 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction and does not have minimums or monthly fees. Braintree offers many of the same payment functionalities as 2Checkout but at lower transaction fees. If youre looking for the security associated with a dedicatedmerchant account, Braintree might be a worthy option for your business.

<TITLE>7 Tips to Protect Your Small Business From Cyberattacks - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Network security for small businesses is particularly crucial. Follow these seven important cybersecurity tips. Cyberattacks like the 2017 Equifax data breach put the personal data of millions at risk. Small businesses, with less security protection and fewer resources dedicated to cybersecurity comparedwithlarger corporations, are an easier target for hackers. Small businesses face an average annual cost of $34,604 on cyber-related incidents,and only 52% of small businesses have a strategy around cybersecurity, according to a 2018 report by Hiscox, an insurance provider. Here's information on cyberattacks, and seven tips to protect your small business.  MORE: Equifax data breach settlement guide A cyberattack is an unauthorized attempt to expose, destroy or access your data. Forty-seven percent of small businesses suffered at least one cyberattack in the past year, according to the Hiscox report. Here are three common types of cyberattacks. Malware:Short for "malicious software," malware acts against the intent of the user, and can come in the form of a virus, Trojan horse or worm. Ransomware is a form of malware that demands money to avoid a negative consequence,such as permanently deleting your data or publishing it publicly. Phishing:This is when scammers send fraudulent emails or text messages that may look like theyre from a reputable company, like your bank or credit card provider. Phishing scams often tell you to click a link or open an attachment, and can then steal sensitive data, such as your credit card or website login information. Man-in-the-middle attack:This type of attack happens when scammers secretly intercept communication between two parties to steal login credentials or account details. Man-in-the-middle attacks can occur in areas with free public Wi-Fi hot spots, as scammersmay set up fake Wi-Fi connections with names that sound similar to a nearby business. Once youve connected to the scammers Wi-Fi, they can monitor your online activities and steal your personal information, according to Symantec Corporation. National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM), held every October, raises awareness about the importance of cybersecurity. The NCSAM toolkit offers tips and resources to protect against cybersecurity threats. The SBA also offers a self-guided online course in cybersecurity basics. Your cybersecurity plan should include an employee trainingprogram and an incident response plan. The first step to securing your network is to make sure your employees understand security policies and procedures. Training shouldnt be a one-and-done deal; schedule yearly or semi-yearly refresher courses to keep security top of mind. Help your employees understand the importance of updating their software,adopting security best practices and knowing what to do if they identify a possible security breach. The faster you act in the face of a cyberattack, the better youll be able to mitigate the damage. An incident response plan will have crucial information such as: Whom to contact. Where data and data backups are stored. When to contact law enforcement or the public about a breach. The Federal Communications Commission offers a cyberplanner to help small-business owners create a plan to protect their business. (You can generatea customized plan at the bottom of the page after you create it.) The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) advises government agencies on password best practices. According to the organizations Digital Identity Guidelines, NIST recommends passwords be at least eight characters long and notes that length is more beneficial than complexity. Allow your employees to create long, unique passwords that are easy for them to remember. If you deal with highly sensitive data, you may want to require multifactor authentication, which requires users to present at least two identifying factors, like a password and a code, before gaining access to systems or programs. Think of it like an ATM, which requires a combination of a bank card and a PIN to access funds. Nearly half of all malicious email attachments come from office files, according to Symantecs 2019 Internet Security Threat Report. Basic email safety precautions, like not opening suspicious attachments or links, are a first step that can be covered in your employee training plan. If you deal with clients personal data, you can also encrypt documents so both the sender and the recipient need a passcode to open it. A firewall acts as a digital shield, preventing malicious software or traffic from reaching your network. There are many kinds of firewalls, but they fall into two broad categories: hardware or software. Some firewalls also have virus-scanning capabilities. If yours doesnt, be sureto also install antivirus software that scans your computer to identify and remove any malware that has made it through your firewall. It can help you control a data breach more efficiently by alerting you to an issue, instead of your having to search for the problem after something goes wrong. Wi-Fi equipment is not secure when you first buy it. Your device comes with a default password, but make sure your network is encrypted with your own, unique password. Your router will likely allow you to choose from multiple kinds of passwords; one of the most secure is a Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) code. Youll also want to hide your network, meaning the router does not broadcast the network name. If customers or clients will need access to Wi-Fi, you can set up a guest account that has a different password and security measures, which prevents them from having access to your main network. Its crucial to work with your bank or payment processor to ensure that youve installed any and all software updates. The more complex your payment system, the harder it will be to secure, but the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council offers a guide to help you identify the system you use and how to protect it.

Working capital is a powerful indicator of the success of your business, and it gives you borrowing power. Working capital is the money small businesses have at hand to cover day-to-day expenses. It's an important indicator of the businesss financial health. It acts as a cushion and offers opportunities for growth. Working capital is an important financial metric to understand because it: Gives you borrowing power: Lenders and other creditors will look at it as a measure of your companys overall health and your businesss ability to take on new debt. Can fluctuate: Even successful businesses struggle with maintaining enough working capital, especially businesses with seasonal fluctuations and companies with a large volume of outstanding accounts receivable. Analyzing your businesss financials regularly, including the balance sheet and profit and loss statement, can help you plan to meet potential shortfalls. Working capital is the difference between your liquid assets, such as cash or accounts receivable, and the money you owe in the short term, such as payroll, other monthly bills and debt payments. Assets liabilities = working capital If youre short on working capital, getting a small-business loan to fill a temporary shortfall is one solution. Its not wise, however, to use working capital loans to cover long-term investments, such as real estate. Updated Disclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

<TITLE>Time Tracking Apps: The 3 Best Apps on the Market - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Looking for a time tracking app for your small business? Here are three great options. When youre a small-business owner looking for the best time tracking apps, you want to make sure you choosethe right oneout of the gate. How do you decide which one is right for you? Ive spent years interacting with dozens and have to say that the below threeare my favorite. Ive reviewed each of these time tracking apps to help you make the right decision for your business.  MORE: NerdWallet's best small-business apps Editors Note: QuickBooks Time is the Ledgers favorite time tracking app and one of our all-time top small-business apps. QuickBooks Time came onto the scene and took the time tracking market by storm quite a few years ago. It just blew the doors off of everything else out there. It made time tracking sexy, and accomplished this by bringing a mobile app and the energy needed to make it so. QuickBooks Time integrates beautifully with QuickBooks Desktop and Xero. And its the only time tracking app embedded inside QuickBooks Online. There is an excellent mobile app as well as a browser (desktop) app making it a good option for businesses that need time tracking apps for a mobile workforce. Once you connect your QuickBooks software, you can review your options and there is one really important one you most likely want to be sure is checked off Import Vendors as Employees. Unless you know for sure that you will never need to track time for a vendor, such as a subcontractor, this needs to be checked off. Also, and this isnt necessarily obvious, even with that option checked off, the vendors will only come in if you have their profile filled out in QuickBooks Online with a physical and an e-mail address. After that, everything in setting up QuickBooks Time is really simple. The interface is clean. Its different. In the browser app, youre given boxes that open up and can be moved around your screen. Rather than taking you through screens, youre given a dashboard from which to work with and you can open and close things as you need them. Clocking in and out and switching tasks is as easy as the tap of a button on both the mobile and browser apps on this time tracking app. If you clock in on the web app and then log into the mobile app, it will pick up your clocked in time and show you the running time. Then you can clock out from either place, whether online or offline. GPS location tracking gives you a great view into whos working and where they actually are. Setting up QuickBooks Time is fairly simple, but as with any robust application, youll have to spend some timegoing through everything to be sure it is all set up the way you need it. If you have specific payroll needs, such as overtime rules, youll want to spend some time on this. The best thing to do is go through the entire set up area on the left and learn your options so you can get the most out of QuickBooks Time. Also QuickBooks Time has amazing customer support, and when you sign up, someone will reach out to you to make sure you have what you need. Take advantage of this, dont blow it off. More on that below. QuickBooks Time has a great scheduling area, but you wont find it in the navigation initially. Its an add-on that you have to opt in for. If you went through the entire set up area as prescribed above, then youve already seen it. Choose to install it and in a click youll have access. Once you have scheduling turned on, it is very easy to use. Youll find it under Manage in the left navigation. QuickBooks Time project/job-based or shift-based scheduling can be managed from both the browser and the mobile app. In the mobile app, you can view and edit the full schedule, as well as add and assign something to anyone. QuickBooks Time has world-class support with a robust knowledge base, and if you choose this time tracking app, you should use it liberally. There is chat support. I was able to get help on a Sunday. Most companies have the chat on the lower right corner of your screen. QuickBooks Time has it on the left, so look there or you might miss it. If you want a great product thats been around for a bit, with a solid company behind it, then QuickBooks Time is for you. ClockShark came onto my radar on July 3, 2016. Cliff Mitchell, co-Founder andCEO, replied to an email Id sent out about gaining independence by letting go and letting others take some of the daily tasks and to dos off our plates. Soon I discovered that he had a time tracking app and it was even in the Intuit Apps Marketplace for apps that integrate with QuickBooks Online. I thought I had my needs met in that department, but as an app addict, Ive learned to always keep an open mind and keep on top of what is out there. ClockShark integrates beautifully with QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop and Xero. The web interface is nice and clean, and the mobile app is very easy to use. Everything you need to access is neatly organized in navigation across the top. Once youre connected to your accounting software, you can map and bring in your list elements. ClockShark makes this easy to do. One thing to note is that you can add elements from either side (ClockShark or QuickBooks Online) and then map them so they can be synced. ClockShark syncs up about every hour. There is no sync now option. I tested a name change on a customer and it works perfectly. Clocking in and out, whether on the mobile time tracking app or in the browser is as simple as selecting the customer/job, the service and punching in. You can switch jobs at the tap of a button, from either the mobile app or in your browser. If you clock in on the web and then log into the mobile app, there is not a connection, so you wont see your time running there. Clocking out is at the tap of a button. Geo location tracking gives you a great view into who is working and where they actually are. Also worth noting, ClockShark has a trap in case an employee tries to install a location spoofing app. As the admin, you will get a message to that effect. You can set up notifications to remind employees to clock in and out at a set time each day. This is a global setting, not per employee. Set up in ClockShark is very easy. The integration will get a lot of it done. Then you will want to set up the mapping. The app walks you through this step by step. If youve added a new list element, you can click Create New Mappings to let ClockShark know how to map the new items between the element in QuickBooks Online and the element in ClockShark. You can set the auto map direction. This is distinguished to minimize the chances of a conflict. Once you change it, you can wait an hour so that it syncs, and then you can change it again. You can also leave it on manual so that each element is configured by itself, in terms of how it is mapped. Any time you add a new list element, in either QuickBooks Online or ClockShark, you can click to create new mappings and configure it accordingly. ClockShark has a great scheduling section. It is just drop-dead simple to set up schedules and assign them to employees. For now, you can only add or edit schedules on the web app. You can view your schedule on the mobile app, but its view only. ClockShark has a notify employees option, that lets you push a notification to all employees whose schedules have been changed or updated in the past day, three days or week. You can push this notification via mobile, e-mail or both. ClockShark has great support. It uses a live chat support option on its website. I was able to get help from a live person on a Saturday. This was huge, as I do not want to have to spend time searching through a robust knowledge base. Those are often difficult to navigate and make it hard to find very specific things. ClockShark is the new kid on the block with a powerful platform thats worth a look by anyone who either needs a good time tracking solution or is considering switching to something new. Its pricing is competitive, as are the features and benefits. This company is motivated to increase market share and it will work hard to get and keep your business. This is what I call a curve ball. This is an app that I would not have known about, were it not for the fact that Erica, who works with me, was using it. We dont track time in our organization because neither our client billing nor our compensation is based on time. Erica, however, was curious to see how long it was taking her to complete her work on various jobs, so she googled free time tracking (or something like that) and found Time Clock Wizard. Time Clock Wizard does not have any accounting software integrations yet, but I spoke with its live chat support and it sounds like at least a QuickBooks Integration is in the works. Meanwhile they told me that you can get a CSV (Excel) export and that can easily be imported into QuickBooks. It should be noted that this only works with QuickBooks Desktop. There is no way to import time into QuickBooks Online without using another app like Transaction Pro Importer. The interface on both the web and mobile apps isclean. I had to look twice to be sure the mobile app was the same app. The look and feel is a bit inconsistent. On the web, the branding and logo are blue and white. On the mobile app, its black and white. Once I was in, and it was clear I was in the right app, everything looked great. Just different from the web app. The mobile app has a messaging feature. which seems like a cool idea. The ability to chat with co-workers through the mobile app makes a lot of sense. Clocking in and out is straightforward. There were a couple of things I found to be a bit clunky. It was not clear how to include a job during the clock in process. Even after I created a job which cant be done on the fly as I wasclocking in, it wasnt clear how to get the option to choose a job, or edit a previous time entry to include it. Time Clock Wizard's live chat support helped me through it. Once things were set up correctly, it is clear and seamless. When you get started with Time Clock Wizard, make sure you spend some time in the Business Settings under Settings. This is where you can add jobs and locations, and then you have to go into your Clock In Settings, and separately indicate that you want the options available. Once this is done, clocking in and out and assigning the job and location is super easy. Time Clock Wizard has a scheduling area. To schedule something, you select the employee on the left and then click a day in the calendar. This wasnt obvious. I would have liked to see a plus sign or something indicating that this is where you go to add a new schedule. It also does not appear that you can do recurring schedules. The live chat support was helpful, although I found it a bit like pulling teeth trying to get answers to questions. When I explained that I couldnt get a job into a time entry, she gave me support on how to add a job, which Id already done. It was also apparent that chat support was using canned responses to my questions based on keywords. I get why this seems smart, but as a user I actually found it annoying. I was actually considering using this feature in my own live chat support, but now that Ive experienced it from the users end, I wont. If youre not concerned about payroll or accounting integration, then this app might be perfect for you. There is a big push away from time tracking apps for billing and compensation purposes, but as Erica (my employee) has done, you may want something just to see how long it is taking you to do your work. If youre being paid a flat rate, you may want to see what your effective hourly rate is.

<TITLE>Justworks Review 2021: Features, Pricing, Alternatives - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. This Justworks review covers features, plans, reviews and alternatives to help with your HRIS software decision. If you've been looking for a human resource information system (HRIS) for your business, Justworks is likely one of the solutions you're considering.  MORE: NerdWallet's best small-business apps Justworks is one of several HR software platforms that help you take care of vital human resources tasks, all by keeping your information securely controlled in the cloud. This means that you can keep a handle on your staffing, employee directory, benefits programs, healthcare enrollmentand even payroll from anywhere and on any device. Instead of having to rifle through cabinets filled with miscellaneous printouts or dredge through your work computer to find files, HRIS software helps you keep everything you need at the click of a button. One of the most interesting parts of Justworks is its concept of a PEO otherwise known as a professional employer organization. PEOs can help band together small- and medium-sized businesses in order to help them get a better price on a broader array of perks. By being part of the Justworks community, you get the strength and support of a larger company with the headcount to support a dedicated HR team all at a lower price than hiring a team of HR professionals would cost you. And, for the most part, this goes beyond serving as a sales pitch Justworks offers insurance plans for customers to choose from, workers compensationand liability insuranceand even real-life consultants to help walk you through complex questions and unique situations. Justworks and its competitors are about as close to having a software platform serve as your small businesss human resources department as you can get. Whether you need help managing your onboarding processes, job listings, employee time off tracking, or making sure youre compliant with Affordable Care Act-related employment rules, Justworks and HRIS platforms have you covered. Justworks also helps you manage commuter benefits, disability leave, fitness and gym memberships and other benefits, as well. And if that wasnt enough, Justworks also offers integrations with other popular professional platforms to help keep every part of your companys software ecosystem in sync. Justworks is a platform that delivers HR assistance bundled into one helpful program. Theres a right-sized solution for just about every small business. If you only need the basics such as payroll management, compliance assistance and straightforward HR tools Justworks has you covered. Or, if you need a robust plan for your company that includes tax filings, company calendars, software integrations, COBRA administration and a slew of additional features (that will be covered later), theres an option for you as well. The Justworks website breaks out company sizes into four categories: two-four employees, five-24 employees, 25-99 employees, or 100 employees or more. You can, of course, sign up for a smaller or larger Justworks package, depending on what your business needs are. Better yet, you can even create a custom plan designed exclusively for your business. All you need to do is provide the Justworks plan builder tool with the number of employees you have, the state in which you operate and a few industry-related details. From there, Justworks will give you a custom quote specifically created to fit your anticipated budget and needs. Justworks sets itself apart with how flexible, robust and straightforward the companys products are. Theres a ton of transparency with regard to pricing, support and even the insurance plans Justworks can help customers get for their small businesses. When youre looking at a Justworks plan, there are few details you wont be able to find in black and white on its site. Thats a nice change of pace compared to other HRIS providers who typically require you to speak to a sales representative before you can get a quote. Photo credit: Justworks  All of the amazing features Justworks provides dont necessarily come cheap. There are plenty of HRIS providers across the price spectrum, and Justworks is toward the higher end of the price range. Thats probably not surprising, given how much the platform provides and the level of white-glove support that comes with its Plus plan memberships. But to Justworks credit, it does provide a price comparison tool right on its website. This tool lets you see how Justworks stacks up against its competitors in terms of benefits, pricing and fees, HR tool functionality, payments and payroll management, compliance support and even user experience. This tool doesnt hit you over the head with a sales pitch, either it does a great job of laying out the differences in competitors offers in a straightforward manner. Justworks has two main pricing tiers. The Justworks Basic plan ranges from $49 per month, per employee to $39 per month, per employee, depending on how many employees you have. This plan gets you, well, the basics meaning payroll management, compliance support and HR management tools. In terms of price versus features, its tough to tell whether this is going to provide you with the best bang for your buck. Most HRIS providers include these features in their less expensive, lower-tier plans (save for compliance, which is often included in higher-priced packages only). The second package, Justworks Plus, goes way beyond the scope of the Basic plan.This level of service doesnt come cheap, though: Justworks Plus ranges between $99 per user, per month to $79 per user, per month depending on the size of your organization. This service tier gets you the standard slate of features: automated payroll, HR tools, compliance support and 24/7 customer service. Perhaps more importantly, youll also get access to Justworks contractor payment portal, payroll tax filings, W-2 and 1099 filings, unemployment insurance filings, workers comp assistance, employment practices liability insurance, online employee onboarding tools, paid time off management, company directory management assistance, robust reporting and access to accounting software integrations. Steep as this price may seem to some, the amount of support and automation that comes standard with this plan may be worth it for you if youre strapped for time, growing rapidly, or just want a solution to take the burden of managing these disparate tasks off your shoulders. Paying a little extra for a high-quality product can end up saving you time and frustration in the long run, which translates into real dollars over time. If the baked-in functionality within a JustWorks Plus account werent enough for you, theres also a thorough menu of benefits, perks and other offerings that small businesses dont usually qualify for. This is where the idea of a PEO begins to make more sense. By bundling common services usually reserved for big companies together, JustWorks is able to provide top-tier benefits to its clients at reasonable prices. These kinds of benefits include medical insurance, dental and vision insurance, life and disability insurance, health and wellness perks, a health advocate service, health savings and flexible spending accounts, 401(k) programs and commuter benefits. These optional add-ons make it easy for small businesses to compete for top talent, mostly by offering a competitive slate of fringe benefits that can take away some of the advantages formerly enjoyed by large-scale businesses exclusively. By banding its customers together, Justworks enables each of these participating groups to get a leg up in the race for talent another expense that can help you generate long-term revenue through excellent hires. Photo credit: Justworks  As with just about any HRIS system, Justworks reviews include reasons for and against selecting this option amongst a crowded field of contenders. Most of the reviews center around core features, functionality, user experience and whether or not Justworks provides enough bang for your buck. The good news is that the average Justworks review gives the company exceedingly high marks customers tend to be more than satisfied with the platform, and a fair number of them even rave about how much they love Justworks after having tried other systems in the past. Here are the major consideration factors youll find in most Justworks reviews online. Most Justworks reviews dont just express satisfaction with the product they rave about it. Some of the most common reasons for this much positivity center around the variety of benefits Justworks makes available to its customers. The more benefits Justworks allows for, the more benefits companies are able to give to their employees. That, in turn, leads to greater employee satisfaction, which often translates into better employee retention (and, if youre really onto something, increased revenue). The Justworks environment makes it easy to offer top-tier benefits in a way thats much more affordable for small businesses than it would be for companies to do it on their own. Justworks also gets high marks for customer service. Its team of experts help new and existing clients walk through the implementation of new features and add-ons, can provide detailed walkthroughs of the platform, and are available every step of the way to make your experience with Justworks as positive as possible. Considering how nerve-wracking and time-consuming it can be to onboard a new tool, particularly when there is no room for error, the fact that Justworks is willing to do what it takes to make customers feel secure and happy is a huge plus for most users. Of course, there are more than a few things that reviewers dont love about Justworks. For example, theres a lack of e-sign functionality that some users said can slow down onboarding processes. Other users complained that the software platforms product set was less robust than some of its more established competitors. Even these reviews with a fair share of negative feedback were still mostly positive. This is an encouraging sign for anyone in the market for a PEO or HRIS system, as there are always areas where companies can improve and expand on what they give to their clients. One other sticking point for some was Justworks pricing. Neither option is on the less-expensive end of the spectrum. Some Justworks competitors offer their services for far less, particularly when comparing Justworks Basic to other offerings. In fact, some of these alternative providers even let customers use their platforms for free, albeit with a small number of users and limited functionality. The HRIS space is full of competition, which can be a great thing if youre in the market for a provider. There are a slew of Justworks alternatives out there worth considering. Some focus on affordability, others on customizability and reporting features. Each of them provides a unique value proposition that either rivals Justworks or takes a different path, hoping to reach a different subset of small businesses with divergent needs. Here are a few of the best Justworks alternatives, as well as details on what sets it apart. TriNet is a cloud-based HR platform that helps small- and medium-sized businesses with everything related to hiring, managing and retaining their talent. TriNet helps companies manage payroll, HR tasks, risk mitigation and compliance, and a robust technology platform that can accommodate timesheet generation, reporting and document retention. Unlike Justworks, TriNet doesnt provide pricing information on its website: instead, you need to reach out to a TriNet representative in order to talk more about your needs and get a custom quote. This provides a suboptimal user experience, and can add time and frustration to your platform onboarding process. That, and the company doesnt have a fantastic track record with handling employee troubleshooting, which can cause frustration over the long run. Zenefits is another strong competitor in the HRIS arena. Much like Justworks and TriNet, Zenefits helps small-business owners keep track of all of their employee management concerns within one handy, cloud-based platform. A Zenefits membership will avail you to benefits management, payroll maintenance and compliance-related assistance. Setting up your payroll with the Zenefits platform is a snap, and the dashboard helps you take a birds eye view of your companys full HR initiatives and needs. Plus, like Justworks, Zenefits helps small businesses pick insurance plans for their employees if companies do not already have existing insurance providers, or if theyre looking to make a switch. Zenefits is also competitively priced compared to Justworks. Zenefits Standard costs $40 per month, with every user costing an additional $5 per month. This plan gives you employee onboarding and tracking support, as well as access to the Zenefits app for you and your employees. Zenefits Advanced costs the same $40 per month, with an additional $9 per month per user. This support level gives you access to Zenefits ACA compliance tools, time off tracker, compliance support and the ability to create an HR library to build company policies. If payroll administration is your primary concern, Gusto can be a great option for you. Gusto specializes in all things payment, and does it with ease for both you and your staff. Gusto does offer additional HR capabilities, but doesnt come close to offering the same suite of options youd get with Justworks. Granted, Gusto isnt designed to provide the all-in-one solution that other competitors can boast about, but theres a ton to love about Gusto if you need straightforward assistance (and dont mind onboarding a few different complementary tools along the way). Gusto offers three packages. Gusto also has a new option for contractor-only employers, who simply pay the $6/employee rate and no base price. Gusto Core provides payroll processing support at $39 a month, and an additional $6 per employee per month. Gusto Complete includes HR tools and additional functionality, costing the same base price as Core but with a $12 per employee monthly charge. Gusto Concierge costs $149 per month and $12 per employee monthly, but gives you access to all of the tools in the lower-tier plans, as well as access to HR professionals and customer support. This can come in handy if you have complex HR questions often, albeit for more money than JustWorks most robust package costs.

<TITLE>C Corporation: Higher Taxes, More Flexibility - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. A C corporation is a limited liability entity that allows an unlimited number of investors. A C corporation may be the right business structure for your small business if it's ready for the big time. McDonald's, Starbucks, Apple: Each is a huge business that grew quickly from scratch. Not coincidentally, each is a C-corp. What are the benefits and the drawbacks of structuring your business as a C-corp? And is your company ready to be one? The main reason to set up your small business as a C-corp is to be able to tap into a bigger pool of investors and have more options for expanding your company. You wouldnt have to rely heavily on small-business loans. Butadopting this business structure would probably saddle you with a bigger tax obligation. Be aware that C-corps are a complicated way to organize a business. A C-corp, like an S-corp, is a limited liability entity, which means the company, not its shareholders or owners, is held legally liable for the companys debt and other obligations. Also, you can bring in an unlimited number of investors when your business is structured as a C corporation. They can be individuals or entities, such as a bank or an investment group, and they can have different ways of being a shareholder of your company through the various classes of stock youre allowed to issue. Virtually all public companies are C-corps. However, youll have to deal with what the IRS calls double taxation. Your corporation will pay taxes on its profits. And when you pay dividends out to your shareholders, theyll be liable for taxes on those dividends, even though the earnings were already taxed at the corporate level. Unlimited investors.Lets say you want to scale up your coffee shop business so it has a regional or national presence. You need an infusion of cash for that, and as a C corporation, you can have as many investors as are willing to purchase a chunk of your company. Those shareholders can be businesses or individuals, foreign or domestic. Youll also be able to offer different classes of stock. This gives you more options than an S corporation, which is allowed to have only 100 shareholders and has restrictions on who can own shares. Investors love a C-corp.Venture capitalists, even some angel investors, are willing to invest in a company only if they can secure preferred shares of stock, according to Laura Norris, director of the Entrepreneurs Law Clinic at the Santa Clara University School of Law. Indeed, many of them, if they are for-profit businesses or not based in the United States, cant invest in S-corps, and many prefer not to wade into investing in LLCs. Moreover, being a C-corp signals your companys potential. It means your business is less constrained in its access to capital; it can tap equity investors to fund its growth. This comes into play, in particular, if you plan to take your business public. Minimize health care costs.As the owner of a C-corp, you can deduct your health care insurance premiums from your taxes, and your business can fully deduct the amount on its corporate return. Double taxation of profits.Double taxation is a common reason many small-business owners choose not to set up as a C-corp. If your C-corp makes a profit, the IRS will tax it. Then, if you and other investors take a dividend, those proceeds are taxed again on your personal tax return and theirs. The government has effectively taken two bites of your apple, compared to the one it gets with businesses structured as pass-through entities. Complexity.Owning and running a corporation in a legally compliant way is not a do-it-yourself project. There are federal and state filing and tax requirements to be metand corporate formalities to be observed, such as holding annual shareholder meetings. To organize your business as a C corporation and keep it in line, youll need a lawyer and an accountant perhaps teams of both and theywill cost you time, money and energy. Pick a name for the company: Name your corporation, then do a thorough search of public databases in the state of incorporation and in any state in which you plan to do business. The website of the secretary of states office (or state equivalent agency) is a good place to start. Get an Employer Identification Number: If you dont already have one, get an EIN. The IRS requires all corporations to have one. Name officers, a board of directors and draft a set of bylaws: This is a state requirement from the very inception of the corporation. New York, for example, requires new corporations to hold an organization meeting to elect a board and enact bylaws. Incorporate your business: You can register your business with different state agencies on the U.S. Small Business Administration website. Each state has its own forms, procedures and fees. For example, it costs about $100 to file articles of incorporation in California and about $125 in New York. The agency in charge of business entities could have different names. For example, in California, youll need to check with the secretary of state, while a similar office is called the Division of Corporations in Delaware.

We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. SmartBiz provides low-cost SBA loans for business expansion or debt refinancing. Only established businesses will qualify. 6.73 - 10.29% 650 Competitive rates among online lenders. Faster than getting an SBA loan from a bank. Must have strong financials, supported by personal and business tax returns for the past 3 years. Stringent rules on use of proceeds. Requires business lien and personal guarantee. CARES Act: Coronavirus relief and SBA loans for small businesses. SmartBiz offers an easier and quicker way to get a Small Business Administration loan, or SBA loan, than from a traditional bank. SmartBiz may be a good fit for your business if you: Need to refinance debt or expand your business: SmartBiz offers SBA 7(a) loans of up to $350,000 at annual percentage rates ranging from 6.73% to 10.29% Hope to finance a real estate purchase: SmartBiz offers SBA 7(a) commercial real estate loans from $500,000 to $5 million at APRs ranging from 5.04% to 5.09%. Need cash within several weeks: The company can fund loans in as little as a week, although it typically takes longer. Have an established business: Minimum requirements for regular SBA 7(a) loans are two years in business and $50,000 in annual revenue.  MORE:Bad credit? Where to find business loans It would be tough to beat the low rates of SBA financing from SmartBiz, which range from an APR of 6.73% to 10.29% for regular term loans and from 5.04% to 5.09% for commercial real estate loans. SmartBizs online platform makes the process less intimidating and cuts the application time significantly, from months for a traditional bank to as little as a week. Whether youre looking to increase inventory, buy equipment or hire more employees, getting an SBA loan from SmartBiz can help you to grow your business. You get the funds you need on manageable repayment terms and at relatively low rates, which also potentially makes it a viable option for refinancing higher-interest debt. Besides standard term loans, SmartBiz also offers 7(a) SBA-backed commercial real estate financing from $500,000 to $5 million. With low borrowing costs and no balloon payments, these loans are a good option for business owners looking to buy commercial real estate or refinance a commercial real estate loan. SmartBiz commercial real estate loans cant be used for new construction. The APR for the loans, which have a 25-year term, ranges from 5.04% to 5.09%. Additional fees may apply depending on the property type and other factors, according to the lender. For commercial real estate loans, at least 51% of the property youre buying has to be occupied by and used by your business. SmartBiz says its partner lenders typically require a 15% down payment, although a 10% down payment with additional collateral could be acceptable. Theres a prepayment penalty in the first three years of a 25-year commercial real estate loan. You must pay 5% of the loan amount if you pay back the loan in the first year, 3% in the second year and 1% in the third year. There are no prepayment penalties after the third year for the remaining life of the loan. Minimum qualifications for SmartBizs commercial real estate loan: 675+ personal credit score. At least two years in business. $50,000+ in annual revenue. SmartBizs platform is a marketplace in which your application is evaluated against the credit requirements of SBA preferred lenders; it currently haseight bank partners. The advantage, the company says, is that it can match you to the bank best suited to your needs, boosting your chances of getting approved. SmartBiz also offers a free online tool, calledSmartBiz Advisor, that shows your probability of loan approval and advice on how to increase your approval odds. The tool provides personalized insight into factors used by lenders to evaluate your business, such as its debt coverage, debt usage and business revenue trends. You dont need a really high personal credit score to get a SmartBiz loan, but it should be good. Borrowers average 705, according to the company. The typical SmartBiz borrower has 10 years in business and annual revenue of $1 million. SmartBiz uses key indicators to evaluate whetheryoure a good fit for a loan. For loans smaller than $150,000, you should have annual revenue of at least $120,000. For loans over $150,000, you should have annual revenue of about $300,000. Your business also needs to be healthy, with no bankruptcies and a clean record when it comes to meeting debt obligations. Getting an SBA loan directly from a traditional bank would help you save on financing costs. SmartBiz takes a 4% cut from the approved loan to cover referral and packaging fees and passes on bank closing costs to the borrower. Those bank closing costs usually add $317 and would include standard bank fees, according to SmartBiz. SmartBiz has found a way to speed up the process of applying and getting approved for an SBA loan. But you still need to meet the SBAs requirements, which can be intimidating. The SBA even has a list of the types of small businesses that shouldnt bother applying; they include businesses involved in religious teaching, life insurance, mortgage servicing and real estate development. Even though SmartBiz has streamlined the SBA loan process, approval typically takes longer than it might at other online small-business lenders, some of which dont require the same amount of documentation SmartBiz does. Ifyoud like to compare loan options, NerdWallet has a list of small-business loans that are best for business owners. All of our recommendations are based on the lenders market scope and track record and on the needs of business owners, as well as rates and other factors, so you can make the right financing decision. SmartBiz is an online provider of U.S. Small Business Administration loans. The company is not a direct lender. Instead, it helps small businesses apply for the loans through its network of partner banks. SBA loans are small-business loans guaranteed in part by the U.S. Small Business Administration and issued by participating lenders. Advantages may include high borrowing amounts and lower rates compared to non-SBA loans. It can be hard to get approved for SBA loans. Lenders typically require a good personal credit score, strong annual revenue and at least several years of operating history. Lenders may also require you to secure the SBA loan with collateral, and may require a down payment. Andrew L. Wang is a former content strategist and small-business writer for NerdWallet.

<TITLE>4 Small-Business Innovations That Will Outlast the Pandemic - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. The innovative adaptations small-business owners were forced to make to their operations during COVID-19 may offer benefits for the future. Small businesses that survived the COVID-19 pandemic still face a long road to recovery, but some of the innovations business owners adopted last year may outlast the pandemic itself. If you make it through this, you ask, you learn, you adapt, and I think it only makes you stronger, says Keith Hall, president and CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed. Here are four ways small businesses adapted in response to the pandemic that may have long-lasting effects on future operations, according to industry experts and business owners themselves. The pandemic forced businesses to find new ways to serve their customers and quickly, says Meghan Cruz, director of grassroots advocacy at the National Retail Federation. Now, that small-business owners have built out new infrastructure, like curbside pickup and e-commerce operations, they can continue using the hybrid business models they adopted during the pandemic, she says. Within a few weeks of the pandemic shutdowns, Keith Wallace, founder of the Wine School of Philadelphia, was facing possible bankruptcy. Unable to open the doors of his businesss in-person-only classrooms, Wallace had to cancel wine classes for thousands of people. The only way to survive was to pivot, he said via email. I realized this was the time to try something audacious. Wallace repurposed his office into a recording studio, turned the main classroom into a video studio and taught himself how to produce and edit videos. By September 2020, the school launched its first online-only Level One Sommelier Course, an eight-week program. By December, Wallace was able to recoup about 30% of the businesss income through the online programs. Now, he is working on launching three additional online programs nationally within the next year. This change is forever, he said. Prior to the pandemic, many small-business owners used technology as a secondary approach to business, according to Hall but that shifted in 2020. A 2020 Salesforce report found that growing small businesses were more likely to accelerate the pace of investing in technology due to the pandemic. Previously, we were a company that welcomed guests at our front counters with a handshake and a smile, Clark Twiddy, president of Twiddy & Company, a family-owned vacation rental company in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, said via email. Twiddy said when the company closed its in-person counters due to COVID, investing in technology enabled them to deliver Southern hospitality in a way never before imagined. Twiddy & Company started using Salesforce for customer relationship management, scaled up its phone technology to Genesys, a cloud-based system, and introduced an AI chatbot to help customers on its website. Small businesses have long been an integral part of the communities they inhabit. And during the pandemic, Cruz says, business owners stepped up to help those communities, even when they were in difficult positions themselves. Cruz tells the story of Cardsmart Greetings, a small gift shop in Buffalo, New York, whose owner, Tracey Mangano, ran a hand sanitizer distribution event in her community, despite her business being closed. Cardsmart was recognized by the National Retail Federation and the Qurate Retail Group as part of their Small Business Spotlight series. Small businesses, Cruz says, were able to be there for their communities when the communities needed them the most. And I think that trend will stay. An April 2021 Federal Reserve report concludes that were unlikely to understand exactly how many small businesses have closed their doors since the start of the pandemic until its long behind us. But on the other side of that coin: 4.3 million businesses were formed in 2020, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. That represents a 24% increase in new businesses from 2019. Not all of the growth over the past year can be attributed to people finding their entrepreneurial spirit, Hall says. Many employees who were laid off continued to work in their industry, such as real estate, marketing or accounting. But out of necessity, they became self-employed business owners, Hall says. These self-employed professionals have found opportunities by connecting with other small-business owners looking to outsource back-office work they traditionally did themselves. Theres a fundamental shift in opportunity, Hall says. A fundamental shift in the demand curve for new small businesses. And I think millions of people are going to benefit from that.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Wonder how to start a wholesale business? Our guide can help you start. Learn about product selection to logistics. If you're an entrepreneur who wants to start a business and make a profit, getting into wholesale distributorship can be a great choice As a wholesaler, you'll provide products to other companies for a profit. It can seem overwhelming, though, to think of everything that goes into how to start a wholesale business: financial planning, a clear business plan, sourcing items, and finding space are just the beginning steps you'll need to figure out. If you're wondering how to start a wholesale business, don't worry! We're going to go over the early steps for starting a wholesale business. There's a lot of planning involved and it might take some time, but in the end, you'll be happy you took the time to do things right. Let's get into the first steps you should take when starting a wholesale business. There are many directions you can take your business in when you're researching how to start a wholesale business. You'll probably want to be a wholesaler that focuses on one group of products or another, instead of trying to manage wholesaling different types of goods. There are plenty of options out there and you might already have an idea of what you want to sell. Some options include being a wholesaler of building materials, deciding to sell home goods and food items, or maybe you're interested in wholesaling electronics like televisions. Whatever it is you want to sell, you should do some research to nail your product offerings down before moving on to the other steps. The second step on our how to start a wholesale business list is to come up with a business name and to choose a business entity. You want to make sure that your business will have a unique name that isn't already taken by another business out there. To do this, you can usually check with your state's Secretary of State business search page. Many allow you to search business names online to see whether the name you want is available. You should also choose a business entity. Different entities or business structures have different benefits they offer. Some wholesalers operate as an LLC, which shields them from personal liability while providing the option to be taxed either as a sole proprietor or corporation. Some might find it beneficial to register as an S-corp for tax purposes. Whatever you choose, first consider whether you want your personal assets protected from any legal action the business might face. You may want to consult a business attorney or an accountant to help you figure out which entity will be most beneficial come tax season. This step includes much of the heavy lifting of how to start a wholesale business, but if you completed Step 1 and Step 2, you're probably pretty prepared for this. When you're writing a business plan for your new wholesale business, there are some things you should be sure to include. Your business plan can be written from scratch, using a business plan software program, or come from a business plan template. Whatever you choose, be sure that your plan includes a summary, an overview of the company and structure, and an in-depth market analysis. The market analysis is key because it shows whether or not you've done research to figure out if there is enough of a demand to keep your business running. A lack of market demand is one of the biggest reasons small businesses fail. Also, list some manufacturers you might be working with and their prices. This is important for you creating a cost analysis and estimating when you might turn a profit to start making money. When it comes to how to start a wholesale business, licensing and permits will be an important part of your research process. Laws about this vary by state. A wholesale license can have different names in different states; some call it a "resale license" instead because it allows you to resell goods. Check with your state's tax office, which you can find here, about how to obtain a wholesale license. You can also check with your Secretary of State's office for any other types of business licensesor permits you may need. You'll also want to apply for an employer identification number. If you're starting a wholesale business, you'll need it to file taxes among other things. You can apply online directly on the IRS website, or you can apply by fax or mail. Applying online is quick and you can get your EIN in a matter of minutes. Not all entity types are required to have an EIN (sole proprietorships that don't have employees file taxes using their social security number) but it makes running your business easier and will be necessary to do things like open a business credit card. While the steps above are helpful, they're just a start and there's plenty more you'll have to do when you're learning how to start a wholesale business. This is where planning will get specific, since the logistics you'll have to figure out before starting your wholesale business will vary depending on the specifics of your business plan, location, budget, who you're doing business with, and what you intend to provide. These include, but are not limited to: Choosing manufacturers to work with:Aside from large-scale manufacturers, you can also source products from independent artisans or import products from overseas. Along with price, you'll need to factor in speed, quality, and location to select your suppliers. Getting warehouse space: When you're just starting out, working out of your garage might be okay. But as you grow, make note of how much space you need, and start looking for a location large enough to accommodate your operations. This will probably include inventory, machinery, and employee necessities, like a break room and bathrooms. Eventually, as we'll discuss below, you may want to expand to another space. Choose a shipper if you'll be shipping goods: Cost, speed, and reliability are all factors, but there may be other considerations, like a company's history with customs, if you're shipping internationally or are shipping unusual items. Consider getting a lawyer to review your registrations and paperwork: Registration and business insurance requirements will vary by state and can be complex to figure out when starting a wholesale business, so this may be a useful step for you. A business attorney may also be able to advise you on your insurance needs. Hiring employees: When you're hiring employees for your wholesale business, you'll need staff to cover purchases, sales, finances, and day-to-day warehouse operations. Consider recruiting employees from trade shows or professional organizations, like The National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. We'll go into the different roles you can hire for below. After you're done looking into how to start a wholesale business, you should still try to think of more lucrative ways that you can continually grow your operations. If you're complacent with your business goals, it'll be easier for a competitor to swoop in and overtake you. Here are five ways to ensure you can flourish after starting a wholesale business: If you want to increase sales and grow your overall business when starting a wholesale business, you can think about expanding your product lines or who you serve. For example, if youre a specialty wholesaler that specializes in providing retail products, you could start offering items to different types of merchants. Or, if youre a general merchandise wholesaler that primarily offers electrical supplies, you could start selling other resources, like plumbing materials. These are just a few examples of how you can increase your wholesale businesss product lines to include new options. Ultimately, you'll need to listen to your customer base and see where you could better meet their needs. By doing this, you can develop your company and ensure that youre taking into consideration what your existing customers care about. Another way to grow your wholesale business is to invest in new small business marketing efforts. If you dont promote your businesss services, you cant expect your customer base to grow. Similarly, you also aren't going to benefit if you keep trying the same types of marketing, only to end up with no results. Instead, conduct deep research about your ideal customer demographics, and determine the types of marketing efforts that will attract them. Think about these kinds of tactics when you're starting a wholesale business: Send direct mail.Running direct mail campaigns is an affordable, yet effective way to market your business. You can send mail to prospective clients with information about your latest promotions. Make sure that your mailed campaigns are attention-grabbing and that they boast incentives that patrons will want to take advantage of. Advertise in relevant publications.Many business owners forget about the benefits that print marketing can bring. With an increased attention put on digital marketing these days, you might not have tried purchasing ad space in local or industry-related publications, like wholesale trade magazines. These types of advertising opportunities can be a great way to reach your desired customers. Optimize your website.Having a website for your wholesale business might seem fairly obvious, but your site could be missing out on important components. You should make sure that your businesss website is user-friendly and well-branded, so that current and potential customers can use it as a resource. You should also have your businesss contact information clearly listed, and provide information about your products and their typical delivery schedules, so that customers can be informed of what to expect prior to placing an order. Post sponsored media content.On social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter, you can publish sponsored social media posts. These posts can be targeted to your ideal customer's demographics, which is what makes social posts an asset to your marketing strategy. For instance, you could target a post toward individuals of a certain age and with a specific job title in your businesss area, to ensure that the people seeing your post are more likely to become potential customers. If your wholesale business location is small, with limited room for necessary equipment or technology, or is an inconvenient area, it might be time to move to a better location. In addition, you could even open an additional location. By having a new operating location for your wholesale business, youll likely be able to produce more wholesale goods, which can, in turn, lead to more sales. To expand your wholesale business, you should consider hiring additional employees. This could be done by hiring more individuals for an existing team, or creating a new position that will likely lead to improved productivity and increased sales. Below, well list a few different types of wholesale positions that you could consider hiring: Sales managers Technology specialists Production leads or assemblers Truck drivers/movers Stock clerks Administrative assistants Bookkeepers Wholesale buyers When you're hiring your first employees, you should ensure that the roles youre looking to fill are necessary and will help your business grow. For example, if youre hoping to attract more customers, expanding your sales team makes the most sense; but if you need to generate more orders faster, you might need to recruit additional truck drivers instead. Having state-of-the-art technology to help improve business processes is imperative. Your business will benefit a ton from having up-to-date tech that can help you grow: Inventory management.This is one of the most crucial items on the how to start a wholesale business checklist. You should always be aware of upcoming orders, available inventory, and incoming supplies. To remain organized, we suggest implementing wholesale inventory management technology, which will help you track inventory in real time. Cloud technology.Its important to be able to access data remotely, especially if you have multiple operating locations, or are working from home. Due to this, your business could benefit from using cloud technology services. Customer management software.With a reliable customer management software, you can track interactions, store client data, view lead process, and set up automations, in addition to other applications. Having a customer management software program will enable you to refine your sales process, and guarantee that important tasks arent forgotten about. Whether you're just learning how to start a wholesale business, or you're looking to expand your existing operation, these tips should help you establish a solid base for your company, and give you ideas about what you can invest in to increase profits. Although it can be daunting to take these steps, youll be thankful you did once your wholesale business is thriving. This article originally appeared on JustBusiness, a subsidiary of NerdWallet.

<TITLE>How to Find the Best Virtual Bookkeeping Service for Your Business - NerdWallet</TITLE>

We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Confirming that you and your virtual bookkeeper use the same accounting software product is essential. In the world of small-business accounting, virtual bookkeeping services are becoming more and more common so much so that the practice of bookkeepers traveling to meet with clients is becoming more of the exception than the rule. In fact, I will likely never meet most of my clients in person. It can be difficult to trust a virtual service with your books, and even harder to know which service to choose. To help ease the process, Ill show you how I run my virtual bookkeeping service and explain what to look for in these services, so you can make the best decision possible. Virtual bookkeeping, also known as cloud accounting, is when a bookkeeper or accountant works with their client remotely. This is made possible through accounting software that allows you and your bookkeeper to share an account. With a shared account, your bookkeeper can post your financial transactions, review and update your statements, reconcile your accounts and perform other vital accounting functions without having to meet with you in person. In this arrangement, the accountant and business must utilize the same accounting software to ensure the proper transfer and communication of files. The benefit of using a virtual bookkeeper as a business owner is that it is often cheaper than hiring someone local to work on-site. The bookkeeper can be paid as a contractor and work as little or as much as the business needs. For a bookkeeper, working virtually provides convenience in the form of schedule flexibility and the ability to work from home.  MORE: NerdWallet's best small-business apps Working with remote clients comes with its challenges, but modern technology has made it possible. Heres an example of how I am able to work virtually with clients. It really is all about the apps. The ones I use are: QuickBooks Online. Zoom. Smartsheet. Slack. G Suite (Google Docs). This is the ecosystem that I use to run my virtual bookkeeping service. With these five apps alone I can manage every aspect of my clients needs. QuickBooks allows me to do the actual dirty work of bookkeeping, Zoom lets me virtually meet with clients over video, Smartsheet makes remote project management possible, Slack is for messaging about issues that dont need to be resolved over video and finally, G Suite and Google Docs facilitate easy file management. You should start by asking them what their application ecosystem is. What apps do they use to help provide their services?They need the following generic structure in place, which is covered by the apps above, in order: Core accounting/general ledger app (QuickBooks Online). Remote web conferencing app (Zoom). Project management (Smartsheet). Communications (Slack.) File and document management (G Suite). Some of the apps might be different, but if your prospective virtual bookkeeping service can cover these five bases, then there is a good chance youre covered. It will be a lot harder to work with a virtual bookkeeper if you use QuickBooks and they use FreshBooks or Xero. Therefore, make sure you ask them which accounting app they use for their business and why.Its a fair question. If they are using different software and tools, you should figure out why and use that to determine if you really want to work with them.  MORE: NerdWallet's best accounting software for small businesses A true cloud-based business, including a virtual bookkeeping service, should be actively using social media. They should be participating in forums on LinkedIn and Facebook. In addition to this, they should be producing content that establishes themselves as a thought leader. This way you dont have to rely on the claims they make about what they can do for you. If they are offering advice that others find useful, then you will be able to see that rather than simply taking their word for it. If your prospective virtual bookkeeping service understands the value of adding to the conversation, then it is a good sign that they will be genuinely helpful to your business. So, check up on them. Are they putting out videos? Podcasts? Blog posts? How are they demonstrating their knowledge and expertise? At my company, one of the specific things we teach accountants and bookkeepers who want to run a virtual bookkeeping service is that they should specialize in a few industries. This is true of any bookkeeper in person or virtual that you would hire. Its especially true of virtual bookkeepers, however, because this will determine if the apps they use to do business are relevant to and compatible with your business. Ask your prospective virtual bookkeeping service if they have experience in your industry, and if so, how many clients they have in your industry. You may even ask for a few customer testimonials to be sure that the service is a good fit. A virtual bookkeeping service is all about efficiency. Are you going back and forth with a prospective bookkeeper trying to nail down a time to talk, or do they use a scheduling app? Do they respond quickly? If theyre not efficient about this stage of doing business, this may be a sign that they wont be efficient once you are a client. Ask about their onboarding process. Do they have one? They should be able to provide you with the steps. If they cant, this may be a bad sign. In more traditional bookkeeping services, it was more of a process to get reports out. Someone had to be there to run the report, save it in the right format and send it out. In this age of cloud accounting and virtual bookkeeping services, they should be able to have reports sent to you on a schedule. Dont lead them by asking if they send out reports on a schedule. Simply ask them what the deliverables will be each week or month. Ask about reviewing reports with you. Every virtual bookkeeping service should have an option that includes this. It might (and it should) cost more than their basic level, but the option should be there. If they are pricing by the hour, this is not a good sign. It means that your virtual bookkeeping service has missed the biggest boat of all when it comes to being a cloud-based bookkeeping service. The hourly pricing model doesnt work here. They must offer flat rate pricing a monthly fee in exchange for a well-defined set of deliverables. As an insider in the cloud accounting world, I can tell you that many virtual bookkeeping services dont follow the best practices that have been listed above. If you dont walk away from your initial interactions with your prospective virtual bookkeeping service feeling 100% confident that this company has your back, then just say no. Keep looking. In the end, your virtual bookkeeper should be a partner that can help grow your business affordably. Keep that in mind as you search for the right virtual bookkeeper for your small business.

<TITLE>Loans for Self-Employed Workers: Personal and Business Options - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. If youre self-employed, youre probably used to jumping through a few extra hoops when it comes to finances. Applying for a loan is no different. For personal loans, self-employed workers have access to the same lending options as everyone else though youll probably have to provide some extra documentation to prove to a lender that your income is reliable. And on the business side, companies of all sizes including sole proprietors and freelancers can apply for business credit cards and other financing to help them grow. Whatever type of financing youre seeking, keeping business and personal finances separate is key to a smooth process. Youll need to provide a lender with detailed information about your businesss revenue and expenses. If you dont have a business bank account, consider opening one to make bookkeeping easier. If youre self-employed and seeking to cover a personal expense or grow your business, here are some borrowing options. Lenders almost always ask personal loan applicants to provide proof of their income. If a borrower earns a salary and receives a W-2 from their employer each year, thats pretty straightforward: They just need to submit copies of their tax returns and W-2s. But when borrowers are self-employed, they may need a lot more documentation. Lenders want to see a history of steady, predictable income, and business owners arent always able to give themselves a steady paycheck. Self-employed borrowers typically need to provide lenders with several years of tax returns and 1099s. They may also need profit and loss statements and several months of bank statements. If youre struggling to qualify for a loan on your own, adding a co-signer could help. The co-signer adds their name and signature to the loan, assuring the bank that if you arent able to repay the loan, they will. This can help you build credit while borrowing the funds you need. The co-signer doesn't have access to loan funds. If you need to borrow a small amount of money and have good or excellent credit(a FICO score of 690 or higher), a credit card may be a better fit than a loan. A credit card allows you to borrow small amounts of money, up to a predetermined limit, and pay it back over time. If you pay the balance in full every month, you wont be charged interest on what you borrowed. If you have poor or fair credit (a FICO score of 300 to 689), you can still qualify for some personal credit cards particularly secured credit cards, where you put down a security deposit that the issuer can keep if you are unable to pay the bill. Like a co-signed loan, responsible use of a credit card can help increase your credit score, giving you more options in the future. Payday loans are extremely risky and often leave borrowers in more debt. If you think a payday loan is your only option, try contactinga trusted organization in your community for help instead. Some nonprofits give cash assistance or loans to help people in emergency financial situations. Credit unions may offer payday alternative loans. And some online lendershave loans specifically designed for people with low credit scores. Accessing credit is a key part of growing a small business. Credit cards, lines of credit and business loans can help self-employed workers navigate cash flow issues and make investments to help their businesses expand. Generally, if they qualify, self-employed workers can access all of these types of products to pay for business expenses. A business credit card is a simple way to unlock a small amount of financing right away. It can help you establish a business credit history to qualify for larger loans in the future. And having a business credit card makes it easier to keep personal and business finances separate. Credit limits, interest rates and annual fees on business credit cards can vary depending on each applicant's credit history. Like personal credit cards, some business credit cards offer rewards like cash back, 0% APR introductory periods or travel points and miles. All kinds of businesses can apply for small business credit cards, including sole proprietorships without a formal business structure. To apply, youll need information about your personal finances since you may have to personally guarantee the debt. Be prepared to provide the details about your business, too, including the legal structure, estimated monthly spending and employer identification number. Like a credit card, a line of credit allows a business owner to borrow money as needed and pay off purchases over time. You can use a line of credit to smooth out seasonal cash flow challenges or to invest in purchases that will help grow your business, then pay it back over time. Lenders charge interest on what is borrowed only. Typically, lines of credit offer higher limits than credit cards. Theyre harder to qualify for, though youll probably need several years of established business history. SBA microloans are small loans issued by nonprofit community-based lenders and guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.The program is designed to serve business owners who may struggle to qualify for traditional business loans, so microloans are usually easier to qualify for than term loans or lines of credit. SBA lenders can finance microloans of up to $50,000, though the average is around $13,000. These funds can be used to buy inventory, supplies, machinery, or equipment; to furnish space or for working capital, but cant be used to pay debt or buy property. Interest rates range from 8% to 13% and repayment terms can stretch to six years. If you need to borrow a set amount of money to fund business expenses, you may have considered applying for a small-business loan. To qualify, you will probably need to have been in business for several years and have good or excellent personal credit. Still, lenders may require you to provide a personal guarantee. If your business goes under, you could be personally liable for the debt. Other lenders ask borrowers to provide assets like real estate as collateral or take liens on business assets so they can seize them if the debt goes unpaid.

Below, we outline the major steps involved in starting a car detailing business so that you can make sure that youre prepared for the challenges youll encounter before getting started. It might be tempting to look at this industry and think, Its only car washing, how difficult can it be? But to call car detailing nothing more than car washing is a vast understatement. On top of a thorough understanding of all of the services that your customers will expect you to provide, running a successful car detailing business will require you to have at least a basic level of business acumen as it applies to the field. Thats why, before you start your own business, its a good idea for you to work in the industry for at least a few years. Doing so will allow you to gain real, hands-on experience performing the services that your future business will offerexperience that will come in handy even if you arent the person actively working on customers vehicles every day. Shadowing the manager or business owner will also give you insights into the challenges they face and the logistics of running a business that you need to prepare yourself for. Similarly, while car detailing isnt a field that requires formal training, it can be helpful. Completing an auto detailing certification like the one offered by the International Detailing Association (IDA) can help you quickly learn the knowledge and skills you need to be successful, while also giving you a point of differentiation over your competition. Writing a business plan is often recommended as one of the first steps for opening any business, and with good reason. The act of writing a business plan forces you to consider key details and aspects about your businessdetails youll need to successfully open your business, bring in investors or business partners, or qualify for a business loan or other funding options. Exactly what you include in your business plan will vary depending on the industry and the type of business you plan to open. That being said, the document typically defines what your business will do, how it will make money, where it will operate, how it will be structured, and how you plan to grow and market your services. Important questions for you to answer when writing a business plan for your car detailing business include: Whether you plan to operate out of a physical location like a garage or whether you want to be a mobile car detailing business, whether you plan to work alone or bring on staff, whether you will need business funding to get started, and whether or not you have competitors to consider. This is also a great time to consider the specific services that you plan to offer, as well as how you will price these services. These services might include, but by no means are limited to: Vacuuming Handwashing Full detail Engine detail Paint touch-ups Overspraying Cement removal Black trim restoration Carpet dying Windshield repair Dent repair Its important to ensure that youre pricing your services at a level that the market you operate within is willing to pay; otherwise, you may find it difficult to find customers. Websites like Thumbtack and Angie's List, can be great resources to leverage to see what other car detailers in your area are charging for their services. Not sure how to start drafting your business plan? Luckily, there are many business plan software solutions available for free (or relatively inexpensively) online. One important step involved in completing your business plan is to select the type of business entity that you will structure your detailing business as, whether a sole proprietorship, limited liability corporation (LLC), general partnership, corporation, or something else. While its easy to feel overwhelmed with all of the options, choosing the right business entity structure is important. The structure you choose will impact everything from your tax liability to how you bring in investors (if you choose to do so) to your bankruptcy options should the business fail. Its not something to neglect. Every business and every situation is unique, and you should take your unique situation into account when choosing a business structure. That being said, forming an LLC is probably going to be the easiest and most straightforward option for you as you first launch your detailing business. Compared to a sole proprietorship, an LLC will protect your personal finances in the event that your business fails, preventing you from being held personally liable for your business liabilities. Working with a business attorney or tax professional can be a great option if youre unsure of which entity is the best choice for your business. They can help you understand the positives and negatives associated with each option and can even help you register your business entity at your local secretary of states office or chamber of commerce. Ensuring that your car detailing business has all of the required permits and licenses isnt just a good ideaits necessary. Failing to acquire the proper licenses and permits could result in fines, penalties, the closure of your business and, at worst, jail time. Unfortunately, its difficult to prescribe a complete list of permits that youll need to operate a car detailing business because the precise requirements will vary depending on where you choose to operate your business. At a minimum, you will need a basic state and local business operating license. But other common business licenses and permits youre likely to need include zoning and land use permits, building permits, fire department permits, and a certificate of occupancyespecially if you plan to operate out of a physical location. Different states and localities may also require you to apply for and maintain a car detailing license in order to operate within that locale. In California, for instance, any business engaged in car washing and polishing must register their business to obtain a license. Similarly, its important to remember that car detailing typically requires a lot of water. Individual cities and regions may have their own departments responsible for overseeing air and water pollution. You may need to register your business with this department as well and demonstrate how you will comply with regulations such as water reclamation and disposal requirements. Building a successful business takes a lot of work. Its only natural that you should want to take steps to protect that business so that you can be sure that it will last into the future. This is what makes purchasing business insurance so important. While the types and amounts of business insurance you need will depend on your specific business, there are certain types of insurance that most detailing businesses will need. These include general liability insurance; vehicle and property insurance; and workers compensation, unemployment, and disability insurance. If youre unsure of which types of business insurance you need, or how much coverage you need in each category, working with a business attorney can be an excellent idea. Launching your car detailing business will require an upfront investment to purchase the equipment necessary for doing the job. Exactly what equipment your business will need will depend on how you structure your business and what services you offer; for example, a mobile detailing business will need to invest in a truck or a van, while a detailer operating out of a garage or other physical location will need to invest in that physical space. That being said, commonly needed equipment may include the following: Pressure washer Hot water extractor Water reclamation system Rotary buffers and orbital (dual action) buffers Wet-dry vacuums Carpet extractor Air compressor Various cleaning solutions Towels, buckets, sponges, and brushes While some people may be able to cover these startup costs out of pocket, many individuals find them prohibitive. If you find yourself unable to pay for these with your savings, there are a number of financing options that can help you get your business off the ground. An SBA loan, provided by a bank but guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) is a popular option, as these loans carry low interest rates and generous terms compared to many other forms of funding. Similarly, business term loans can be a great alternative if you find that you dont qualify for an SBA loan. Another popular option, especially when you have to purchase a lot of equipment, is equipment financing. One mistake that many individuals make when launching their first business is not taking steps to separate their personal finances from their business finances. They use their personal checking and savings accounts for both their private and business needs, making it incredibly difficult to track their spending and monitor their income. This can also cause confusion come tax-filing season or in the event that your business is audited by the IRS. Taking the time to separate your businesss finances from your personal finances is a critical step to ensure long-term financial success. An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal business tax ID, is a nine-digit number assigned to your business by the IRS. Every business needs an EIN to apply for a business loan, open a business bank account, apply for a business credit card, andperhaps most importantlyfile taxes. You can apply for your EIN online, by mail, or by fax. Depending on your method of application, you will either receive your number instantly or within a few days or weeks. In order to keep your businesss finances separate from your own, you will need separate accounts with which to save and spend your businesss money. This is why most businesses will open one or more business bank accounts, such as a business checking account (to make payments and purchases with readily available cash), a business savings account (to save money which is not immediately necessary for the day-to-day operation of your business), and a business credit card (to make essential payments and purchases when you do not have cash readily available). You may have a goal to eventually hire an in-house or freelance accountant or bookkeeper to help crunch the numbers, but if youre like the vast majority of small business owners, when you first start out you will be keeping track of your own finances. Choosing business accounting software that aligns with your needs will undoubtedly make running your car detailing business that much easier in the long run. A thoroughly thought-out marketing strategy can help you to both drum up demand when you first launch your detailing service and keep your business growing after those initial first few months. Registering a domain, signing up for Google My Business, and building a web presence for your business are great places to start and are more or less essential for modern businesses. Similarly, designing a logo for your business and using it in your signage, business cards, and other print assets can go far in establishing your brand. While starting any business comes with its own unique challenges, the right level of preparation and forethought can remove many of the variables and confusion associated with starting your car detailing business. Ensuring you have the right training and certifications, drafting a thorough business plan, ensuring your business is licensed and registered, and establishing a financial plan are all critical steps to your success.

<TITLE>How to Perform Payroll in QuickBooks - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Learn the differences between the detail and summary methods for manually entering payroll into QuickBooks Online. There are two ways to manually enter payroll in QuickBooks Online if your payroll software product doesn't integrate with it. Which method you choose will depend on how much detail you want in your payroll reports within QuickBooks Online. Before we get into the two methods, you need to understand the basics, as well as the most common mistakes inexperienced bookkeepers make while entering payroll. Lets assume that all employees are being paid via direct deposit. Your payroll service will take out three payments with each payroll: Net pay Taxes Fees Many bookkeepers make the mistake of simply bookkeeping the net pay to payroll expense and the taxes to the employer tax expense. Heres what they should be instead: Net pay:Net pay is comprised of the gross pay, which is the true expense to the company, less the withholding. The withholding amounts belong to the government. So they are deducted from the employees paycheck and placed in a liability account. That liability is cleared out when the tax payment is made. Taxes:The tax payment is made up of two parts, which means the transaction needs to be split. Part of the payroll tax payment is the withholding that came from the employees paychecks. The other part is the employers share of the taxes. Most of the employers taxes come from matching Social Security and Medicare tax. The payment of the withholding is what zeros out with the payroll liabilities. The employers share of the taxes is an expense that goes on the income statement, along with the gross payroll expense. They each go on separate lines. Fees:The fees simply get booked to a payroll fees expense account. Officers salaries:The other thing worth noting here is that if your company is an S Corp, then you need to break out the officers salaries on a separate line on the income statement.  MORE: NerdWallet's best small-business apps As long as you understand the above first, then this next part should be fairly easy to follow. Most companies will want to book the payroll as a summary. In other words, you would book each of the three transactions described above as a lump sum. The gross pay would be the total gross pay for all employees. Same for the withholding. Then the net pay comes out and matches exactly what comes out of the bank account. For payroll in QuickBooks Online, you record a check for this and everything reconciles just fine. The tax payment is split based on the total withholding for all employees, and the total employer match. Again you write a check in QuickBooks Online with the split between the payroll liabilities and employer taxes, and everything should reconcile. This method is for reporting enthusiasts like me who want it all. I want each paycheck recorded separately, with each employee as a payee. The other situation when you need this is if your payroll company doesnt pull the funds out of your bank, as I described above. Ive seen two services that take out the funds in a strange way. In the detailed method, you record each individual paycheck in the exact manner described above. Instead of recording them as checks in your bank account, you will set up a new bank account in QuickBooks Online. Call it Payroll Clearing. When you record the paychecks in the Payroll Clearing account, you still book the gross pay and the withholding. The balance in the Payroll Clearing account will be negative. When all of the paychecks are in, that negative amount should be exactly equal to the amount of the net pay that comes out of the bank account. When that transaction is posted in the bank account, book it to the Payroll Clearing. That will zero out the payroll clearing. Book the taxes and fees the same way as above. The video above demonstrates how all of this works. My sample report is can be found here. Payroll is normally the biggest expense that a company has. This makes it that much more important to book it correctly. Not sure if your books are correct? Check your payroll entries in QuickBooks Online. Even if you dont understand the accounting side of things, the giveaway is that the payroll checks should be split between gross pay and liabilities. If you see the split, it means that your bookkeeper probably knows what theyre doing.

<TITLE>How to Start a Nonprofit: The Rules and Rewards - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Nonprofit organizations often come from the heart. They canbegin with a goal of addressing a social or community issue or need. Making money may not be on the priority list. But you can still set up your nonprofit in ways that help keep costs down, particularly taxes. You can then directmore funds toward achieving your organizations objectives. The first step is to register your nonprofit in the state where you want to incorporate. An organization called the National Association of State Charity Officials has information on filing requirements for charitable organizations in different states. The U.S. Small Business Administration also has information on the state agencies where you can file papers of incorporation. Once youve registered your nonprofit, you must file IRS Form 1023, which is the formal request that the IRS recognize you as a 501(c)(3) organization eligible for tax exemptions under this rule. If you are going to ask an attorney or some other party to represent you on matters related to your application with the IRS, you also need to fill out and submit Form 2848. Take note: NerdWallet provides info on money-saving online legal services that provide access to lawyers at a lower cost. You also will have to fill out and submit IRS Form 990, or Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax. Timing is an important consideration. According to IRS rules, you must file for nonprofit tax-exempt status by the end of the 27th month after your organization is legally created, which means when your group is formally incorporated. The application can bea long and tedious process, so you'll need patience. The IRS will have a tax specialist go over your application and may ask for more information. But if your nonprofit passes the test, you will get a determination letter recognizing your tax-exempt status. Now that you know the basic steps, lets take a step back. There are different kinds of nonprofits: They can be charitable organizations, such as a group that runs a homeless shelter or an enterprisethat wants to build and maintain parks in a low-income neighborhood. They can be educational institutions, including schools, museums, day care centers or youth sports organizations. They can be religious organizations, such as churches, mosques, synagogues and temples. Because your nonprofit is supposed to be doing work for the public good, your organization can enjoy a host of cost-saving benefits, mainly tax exemptions from federal, state and local governments. But you must comply with IRS rules and other requirements, including that your organizations income and assets not be used to benefit private investors or parties. Registering allows you to take advantage of those cost-saving benefits. The rules and regulations vary by state, so check the requirements in yours. The previously mentioned National Association of State Charity Officials has good advice. You may be required to submit other documents, beyond your bylaws and standard incorporation papers, related to your nonprofit status in some states, according to the National Council of Nonprofits, a nationwide network of U.S. nonprofit organizations. For example, your nonprofit will be required to file a written conflict of interest policy, which states that your organizations members, particularly officers and directors, are required to disclose any potential conflict related to the nonprofits affairs. After registering your nonprofit, applying for this IRS status grants your organization certain tax benefits. The classification is based on Section 501(c)(3) of the tax code, which is why nonprofits are sometimes referred to as 501(c)(3) groups. Having this IRS classification can help in several ways: Your nonprofit will be exempt from paying federal income taxes on earnings. For example, if your organization holds a fundraising event say, a concert or a community auction you wont have to worry about taxes on the money you raise. You organization will be able to accept tax-deductible contributions, which obviously will help you attract more donors and donations. Some nonprofits will be exempt from paying certain employment taxes. Some states and local governments also grant tax exemptions to groups with 501(c)(3) status. Your nonprofit could get discounts from the U.S. Postal Service on mail services. On the other hand, these tax and other benefits come with responsibilities. Youll be expected to keep detailed and comprehensive records of your activities, particularly your finances. For example, your nonprofit will be required to make itsannual tax returns available to the public for inspection. And were not just talking about having them on file in a box stored in the office basement. The IRS requires you to ensurethese documents are readily available at your organizations office during regular business hours, according to an IRS publication on applying for nonprofit tax-exempt status. Then there are restrictions on your nonprofits activities. For example, your organization will be prohibited from taking part in the political campaigns of candidates for local, state or federal office. Your nonprofit also cannot engage in lobbying efforts meant to aidthe interests of a private shareholder or individual. There also are strict rules related to compensation, especially for officers and directors. Nonprofits are expected to pay their executives reasonable but not excessive compensation, according to the National Council of Nonprofits. To figure out what that means, your nonprofit is expected to go through a review process involving an independent body. Most nonprofits rely on grants and financial support from foundations and donors. The National Council of Nonprofits offers information and tips on how to secure funding. There also arestate associations of nonprofits that offer both information and services, including workshops on fundraising. Online small-business loans are another option for nonprofits. BlueVine offers accounts receivable financing to small businesses that sell products or services to other businesses, or B2B firms. But the company also offers financing to nonprofits that have invoices due in one to 12 weeks from other companies, Ed Castano, BlueVine vice president of marketing, tells NerdWallet. (Read our review ofBlueVine.) Nonprofits have played an increasingly important role in society. Setting one up in response to a need in a community is a worthy endeavor. And the good news is the IRS and other agencies have rules that make it easier for nonprofits to survive and thrive. There also are rules that you must follow, including those that govern your activities as an organization. Creating and running a nonprofit, especially one that enjoys federal tax-exempt status, entails strict record-keeping and making sure your operations are in line with IRS requirements.

In addition to the Upserve POS software costs, youll have to pay for the hardware you need to run your POS system.

Upserve serves as your payment processor, so you dont have to worry about integrating with a third party and incorporating costs from them as well. That being said, Upservescredit card processing feesare flat-rate, costing 2.49% plus 15 cents per transaction regardless of your plan.

Upserve POS offers 24/7/365 U.S.-based customer support for all of its software plans, as well as numerous ways to contact support representatives. You also have the option to use the training videos and help desk knowledge baseavailable on the Upserve website. Additionally, if you need help setting up your POS system, you can get specific assistance from the Upserve onboarding team. Upserve provides all of its account holders with a dedicated success manager. Furthermore, recent Upserve POS reviews and previous Breadcrumb POS reviews consistently report that not only is it easy to access customer support, but the support that they receive is helpful. Without a doubt, price is the biggest drawback of using Upserve POS. Upserve POS is expensive. The most basic plan, although it includes an impressive feature set, starts at $59 per month, in addition to a monthly $60 per terminal fee. If you want to add online ordering, inventory management or use of the Upserve software on more than one terminal, youre going to incur another significant monthly fee for each of these services. Even though the Pro plan includes online ordering and inventory management, you still have to pay a sizable fee for additional terminals, not to mention the plan is more than 2x the monthly price of the Core plan. At the end of the day, you can find other POS software options (even specifically for restaurants) that are more cost-effective with comparable capabilities. Another disadvantage of Upserve POS is the lack of payment processing options. Although it can be useful to have Upserve Payments integrated directly into your POS software, Upserve POS doesnt give you the ability to work with other payment providers ormerchant servicesif youd prefer to do so. Even though the flat-rate pricing of Upserve Payments is easy to understand, youre locked into this pricing model and prevented from exploring other possible options in the marketplace. Although Upserve POS offers a wide variety of reporting and insights features, it's lacking in ways you can actually take payments especially when compared to many other POS providers. Many other POS services give you the ability to use amobile card readerto accept credit card payments right on your smartphone. Upserves Tableside device does indeed allow you mobility while operating your point-of-sale; however, you must purchase this hardware device from Upserve as opposedto simply buying a card reader to add to a smartphone you already have. Likewise, Upserve POS has a mobile app, but it only provides insights based on your POS software and doesnt actually give you POS order and payment capabilities. Similarly, whereas many other points of sale provide (or give you the option to have) a virtual terminal, Upserve only seems to offer physical terminals. Essentially, this means although you can use card readers, you dont have the ability to manually input credit card information into your system and process payment that way. The Upserve POS reviews, as well as older Breadcrumb POS reviews, are mostly positive. When Upserve users do mention cons, theyre typically very specific and seem to vary from review to review. Some negatives include: software glitches and connectivity issues, the high cost and a lack of certain customization abilities. To determine if Upserve POS is the right point-of-sale for your business, youll want to compare its services to other providers on the market. Here are two top alternatives to consider: One of the most popular POS providers for small-business owners, Square offers a POS system designed specifically for restaurants. TheSquare POS for Restaurantshas very similar capabilities to Upserve POS: management for menus, front of house, employees, customers, inventory, as well as reporting and integration functionalities. The Square for Restaurants POS software works with Squares payment processing services and its hardware (iPad required). Although the feature-set for Square for Restaurants is incredibly similar to Upserve POS, the big difference between these two systems is pricing. Using the Square for Restaurants POS software costs $0, $60 or $299 and up per month, depending on the plan you choose. In terms of credit card processing,Square, like Upserve, requires that you use its processing service and its in-person rate is 2.6% plus 10 cents per transaction. You can enter payments digitally as well, but this will cost 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction. If price is a deterrent from using Upserve POS, Square for Restaurants is a great alternative youll receive similar features for a much lower monthly fee. For an Android-based alternative, you might look intoToast POS. Like Upserve and Square for Restaurants, Toast provides point-of-sale options specifically for restaurants. Toast POS offers solutions for a variety of businesses in the restaurant industry: bars, bakeries, cafes, fine-dining restaurants and more. The Toast point-of-sale software gives you the ability to create your menu, take and process orders and manage your employees, customer information and inventory. For added monthly fees, you can include gift cards, loyalty programs, delivery and online ordering with your POS. In terms of hardware options, Toast offers a variety of terminals, including a handheldmobile POSterminal and a guest-facing display that allows customers to enter its orders via the tablet touch-screen. Although a little more expensive per month than Square for Restaurants, the Toast POS subscription fee is much less than Upserve POS, at $79 per month. To add more terminals to your service, it will cost $50 per month, per terminal. For credit card payments, Toast requires that you use it as your processor. However, Toast does not list its specific processing rates on its website. It simply says that it offers flat rates that are custom-built for your business. If youre looking for a POS system with features designed for restaurants, a lower monthly fee than Upserve and possible flexibility with credit card processing rates, Toast POS is worth considering.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Here's how to create an invoice in QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online, plus some helpful tips and tricks. If QuickBooks is your business accounting software of choice, youll need to know how to create an invoice with the program.Both QuickBooks Online and Desktop versions enable you to quickly and easily create invoices for your customers.  MORE: NerdWallet's best small-business apps There are three different ways to create invoices in QuickBooks Desktop, also known as QuickBooks Pro. Many QuickBooks users choose to create invoices from scratch, without first creating a sales order or an estimate. The process to create an invoice in QuickBooks from scratch is relatively easy and straightforward: 1. Select Create Invoices from either the home screen or the Customers menu. 2. Select the customer and job from the Customer: Job dropdown menu. If your customer or the job you are working on isnt already in your QuickBooks company file, dont worry. You can easily add this information on the fly by selecting the Add New option from the dropdown menu. This will open a pop-up box. Once you have added and saved your customer and job information, the pop-up box will close and youll be able to continue with your invoice. 3. Youll notice there are some other options at the top of this screen. This article doesn't cover the Class field, but notice there is a Template option. QuickBooks Desktop gives you the option to create and use customizable templates for your invoices. This means you can have different invoice styles for different types of customers, different segments of your business, etc. Before you proceed with your invoice, make sure you have selected the correct template for this particular invoice. 4. Now its time to set the following fields on your invoice: a. Date: QuickBooks Desktop will default to the current date in most cases. Double-check this field to make sure the date shown is the one you want on your invoice. b. Invoice number: The invoice number is automatically generated by QuickBooks Desktop, but you can manually change it if you want. If you try to use a number you have used before, you will get a pop-up dialog box warning you that you are using a duplicate number. c. Bill to, Ship to: This information is populated from the information in QuickBooks Desktop for the customer you are billing. You can manually change it if the invoice needs to go to a different address. d. P.O. Number: Some customers will require you to use their purchase order (P.O.) number on your invoices. You can manually enter that information here. e. Terms: Choosing the correct payment terms is critical to your cash flow.It dictates how many days your client has to pay your invoice. While the terms you choose will depend on your company, or even industry standards, Net 30 is a popular option. f. Rep, Ship, Via, F.O.B: These fields are not used by every company, so this article only touches on them briefly. The Rep field is for the sales rep responsible for the sale to the customer. Ship indicates the date the product or service was shipped or completed. Via shows the delivery method, and F.O.B. (free/freight on board) indicates who owns the product while it is in transit. If these fields dont apply to your business, you can either leave them blank or customize your template so they dont appear at all. 5. Once the invoice is set up, you are ready to enter the information for the products or services your customer has purchased. a. Add time/costs: If you have been entering billable time into QuickBooks Desktop, or if you have incurred costs and marked them as billable to the customer, you can automatically populate the invoice with this information by clicking this icon (shown in the image below). b. Quantity, item Code, description, price each, class and amount: Each of these fields can be manually entered or, if you have set up products or services in advance, you can select the Item Code for those products or services from the dropdown menu and save some data entry. You can edit the Quantity, Description, Price Each and Class fields manually if you need to. (Note: If you want to apply discounts to the invoice, you will need to create a specific item for this.) c. Tax: Sales tax is a tricky thing. Some items on your invoice might be taxable, some might be tax-exempt and some might be taxed at different rates than others. Fortunately, QuickBooks Desktop lets you specify the sales tax rate for each item on your invoice. Choose the correct sales tax code from the dropdown menu in the Tax column of the invoice (if you have set up the product or service in advance, the correct tax code will automatically populate when you enter the item code.) 6. Once you have entered all the products and services for which you are billing the customer, its time to complete the bottom part of the invoice. a. Customer message and memo: You can create the Customer Message field in advance, or you can enter a Customer Message right on the invoice. The Memo field is created manually for each invoice. b. Customer tax code: Just like different products and services might be taxed at different rates, a customer might have a specific sales tax situation. The most common one is a sales tax exemption. You can select the correct tax code from the dropdown menu, and that setting will apply to the entire invoice. If the code is not already in QuickBooks Desktop, you can enter it on the fly by selecting Add New from the dropdown menu. c. Tax: This field is used to set the tax rate for the entire invoice. Like with the customer tax code, this tax code can be selected from the dropdown menu or you can enter it on the fly. 7. Now its time to choose how you will send your invoice. Going back to the top of the screen, youll see you have a number of options. a. If you plan to print and mail the invoice, click the dropdown option under the print icon and choose how you would like to print it. You can choose to print the invoice immediately, save it as a PDF or preview it. b. If you want to email your invoice, click the dropdown option under the email icon. (Note: If you want to email an invoice through QuickBooks Desktop, you have to set up the email preferences in settings.) c. You also have the option to print or email the invoice at a later time, in a batch. Just click the checkbox next to the option you want. d. Finally, you can choose to attach files to your invoice by clicking on the Attach File icon. 8. QuickBooks Desktop performs all the calculations on your invoice for you, but its a good idea to do a quick spot-check to make sure everything looks correct. Once you are pleased with your invoice, click on either the Save & Close button (will save the invoice and close the invoice window) or the Save & New invoice button (will save the invoice and open a new blank invoice screen). Take care not to click the Clear button, as you will lose all your progress and have to restart the invoice from the beginning. A sales order is a record of a sale you have promised to deliver in the future, but you havent fulfilled yet. Some businesses choose to use the sales order feature in QuickBooks Desktop to track these sales. This article doesn't cover how to create a sales order, but heres how you create an invoice from one: 1. Start by selecting the Sales Orders icon from the home screen. 2. You will be taken to the Sales Order form. Use the find button to locate the sales order you wish to create an invoice for, then click on the Create Invoice icon. 3. Youll get a pop-up window asking if you want to create an invoice for all sales orders or just for selected items. Select the option that applies to you, then click on the OK button. 4. If you chose to create an invoice for selected items, youll see a new pop-up box that will allow you to choose what you want to invoice now. Choose the options that apply to you, then click the OK button. 5. Youll now be taken to an invoice screen, populated with the information from the sales order. From here, you can edit and send the invoice as outlined in the previous section. Some customers require an estimate before agreeing to work with you, or perhaps your internal workflow requires you to enter estimates for jobs you are bidding or have won but not yet invoiced. Whatever your situation, if you use estimates in QuickBooks Desktop, you can easily convert them to invoices. The process to create an invoice from an estimate is nearly identical to creating an invoice from a sales order, so well only highlight the three key differences between the two here: 1. You will start by clicking on the Estimates icon on the home screen. 2. Unlike sales orders, where you can invoice for multiple sales orders on one invoice, you can only create one invoice per estimate. 3. If you are using progress invoicing a handy feature that allows you to bill projects in phases you will be prompted to choose how much of the estimate you wish to bill on this particular invoice. This process is very similar to that for choosing sales order items to include on an invoice. The process for creating invoices in QuickBooks Online is very similar to the process for creating invoices in the desktop version: 1. You can create invoices either from scratch or from an estimate. (QuickBooks Online does not have a sales order feature.) 2. You can enter information on the fly, or you can use pre-set products and services rates or sales tax rates. QuickBooks Online does not support specific sales tax rates for individual customers, but you can easily adjust this on the invoice itself. 3. You can email invoices directly to your customers. If you have a QuickBooks Payments account, your invoices will include a payment link, which can dramatically speed up collections. Note: All of the features mentioned below might not be available if you are using QuickBooks Online Simple Start or Essentials. There are two ways to access a blank invoice screen in QuickBooks Online: From the dashboard, start by clicking on the + icon at the top right corner of your screen, then select Invoice from the Customers options on the left side of the dropdown box that appears. By clicking on Sales and then Invoices on the left toolbar. 2. If you chose the first option, you will be taken directly to a blank invoice screen. If you chose the second, you will be taken to a list of all your invoices. To create a new invoice, click on the New Invoice button on this screen. Now its time to create your invoice. Each of the steps below is highlighted on the screenshot at the end of this section. a. Choose a customer from the dropdown menu, or create a new customer on the fly by selecting Add New from the dropdown menu. b. If there is already an email address on file for the customer, it will populate the customer email field. Or, you can enter an email address manually. You can enter multiple email addresses in this field, separating each with a comma. You also have the option of cc-ing or bcc-ing others on this invoice. c. You can select the send later checkbox to batch this invoice to be emailed later. If the box is checked, the invoice will be batched for delivery later. d. If you have QuickBooks Payments enabled, your payment options will appear here. You can toggle options on and off for each invoice. e. The billing address will populate based on information already in QuickBooks Online for the customer, or you can manually enter it. f. Select the payment terms for this invoice using the dropdown menu. g. The invoice date will default to the current date, but you can adjust it if you like. h. The due date is based on the terms for the invoice. You can also manually adjust it. i. The template you use for your invoice will determine any custom fields that appear here. You can switch between templates by clicking on the customize link at the bottom of this screen. j. Just like in QuickBooks Desktop, the Product/Service field can be populated from items you have already created, or you can create new products or services on the fly. The description will automatically populate based on what you have entered for the product/service, but you can customize this field, too. k. Enter the number of items or hours in the Qty (quantity) field. l. The Rate field will populate based on what you have previously entered into QuickBooks Online for this product or service, but you can manually adjust the rate, too. m. Like in QuickBooks Desktop, the Amount field automatically calculates by multiplying the rate by the quantity, but you can manually adjust as well. If you change the total amount, the rate will adjust so the math works out correctly. n. Click the checkbox in the Tax column to indicate the item on this line is taxable. If the box is unchecked, no sales tax bill be calculated for this line. o. If you run out of room on the invoice, you can add more lines by clicking on the add lines button. You can also clear all lines (not advisable, unless you want to start over) and add a subtotal to break up different sections of the invoice. p. As with QuickBooks Desktop, you can manually add a message on the invoice or statement. q. This part requires some attention as well as some knowledge of the sales tax law as it applies to your customer. The circle with the two arrows determines whether any discounts are applied before or after sales tax is calculated. Click on the circle to toggle the fields and adjust the calculation for any discounts. r. Select the correct sales tax rate for this invoice, or choose add new to add a new sales tax rate on the fly. You can also manually calculate the sales tax due and enter it into the box to the right of the sales tax dropdown option. s. If you are applying a discount to the invoice, you can choose to either apply a discounted percentage or a flat dollar amount. t. You can add attachments to the invoice by dragging and dropping them into this area, or by clicking the icon and browsing for them. If you want to send the attachment with the invoice, select the checkbox to the left of the file name after uploading the attachment. u. If at any time you want to abandon the invoice without saving it, you can do so by clicking the cancel button on the bottom left of your screen. We do like that this option is on the opposite side of the screen from the options to save, unlike in the desktop version. v. You can print or preview your invoice by clicking on the link at the bottom center of your screen, or you can set up a recurring invoice by clicking on make recurring. If you click on the make recurring link, a new recurring invoice template will appear (be sure to save your invoice before clicking on this link). w. We recommend saving your work frequently as you work on your invoice (button is at the bottom right of your screen). Otherwise, if your internet connection fails, or if you take so long working on your invoice that QuickBooks Online automatically logs you out of the system, you will lose all your progress. x. Once your invoice is complete, you can click the dropdown arrow to the right of the save and send button to choose between save options, including save and close, save and send, save and new, and save and share. If you are using QuickBooks Onlines progress billing feature, you will want to start your invoicing process from the estimate for the project. The easiest way to get started is by hovering on the Sales link in the left toolbar, then clicking on Customers. On the next screen, either click on the name of the customer from the list or search for the customer in the Find box. Locate the Estimate you wish to use to create your invoice and click on the create invoice link in the Action column. This will open an invoice screen, populated with the estimate details. If you are using progress invoicing, you can choose to create an invoice for a percentage or a certain quantity of the overall estimate. From here, you will complete the invoice as outlined in the previous section.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Choose lenders that meet your needs and seem likely to approve you when applying for a small-business loan. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. If youre wondering how to apply for a small-business loan, you may need financing sooner rather than later. Still, take the time to do your research and find the right fit. It can take months to apply for some small-business loans, like those backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration. But by understanding all your options and not rushing the process, youll be in the best position to get approved and avoid wasting time or money. Here are four steps to apply for a small-business loan. You can get a business loan from banks, alternative online lenders and other sources. The best place to apply for a small-business loan will usually be wherever you qualify for the lowest interest rate. But the following questions should also influence your decision: How good are your finances? Bank and SBA loans typically offer the most competitive interest rates. Those low rates come with strict qualifications though: Youll likely need at least two years in business, strong annual revenue and good credit (many small-business lenders require a FICO score of at least 650) to qualify for funding. If you have bad credit or cant otherwise hit those marks, your best bet may be to apply for a small-business loan from an online lender. What type of funding do you need? Multiple types of business loans are available, but not from every lender. If youre buying heavy-duty machinery, for example, a lender with dedicated equipment financing may make sense. For ongoing working capital, consider a business line of credit you can draw from as needed. If you want to apply for an SBA loan, you can find participating lenders using the agencys lender match tool. When do you need the loan? If you need financing in a hurry, you may want to prioritize online lenders. These lenders may have automated processes that let them review applications quickly and offer fast business loans. If you can wait for more than a few days, SBA Express loans may offer quicker turnaround times than other federal options but similar benefits, like competitive rates and flexible terms. If multiple lenders meet your needs, see if any let you pre-qualify for an estimated interest rate. This option will likely be more common with online lenders. For traditional lenders like banks, consider speaking with a loan officer before applying to ensure you meet the qualifications. Each lender may require different documentation for its small-business loan application. Most will likely want some form of the following: Information about your business. These items will range from the basic like your businesss name, address and tax ID to more detailed documentation. For example, a lender may want a business plan or proposal outlining how youll use the loan. Financial statements for you and your business. These may include documentation of your annual revenue, such as profit and loss statements, plus tax returns and bank account statements for business owners and the business itself. Details about the businesss owners. You may need information like the names, Social Security numbers and addresses for anyone who owns more than a certain percentage of your company, typically 20% or 25% depending on the lender or loan. The SBAs loan application checklist is a great place to start if youre not sure what you might need. Government small-business loans typically require more paperwork than other options, so if you have everything the SBA wants, you should be well-prepared for whatever a lender asks for. Before applying for a small-business loan, consider having someone else look over your application, especially if it includes information that could be open to interpretation, like a business plan. One good potential resource is a Small Business Development Center, or SBDC. SBDCs are local organizations partially supported by the federal government. Each branch includes qualified business professionals who can provide assistance on topics such as running a business and obtaining financing. You can locate SBDCs in your state using the SBAs finder tool. Make sure to double-check that your business loan application includes everything the lender asked for and in the appropriate format. The lender may have questions as it evaluates your application, but by reducing unnecessary back and forth, youll get a decision as quickly as possible. Once everything is in order, how youll actually apply for the small-business loan will depend on the lender. For example, online lender Fundbox lets you link your business accounts through its website to qualify for financing. More traditional financial institutions, like banks and credit unions, may make you apply at a branch or over the phone. For example, Bank of America accepts online applications for some of its products like its business auto loans but requires an in-person or phone appointment for others. No matter how you submit your application, find out the lenders typical turnaround time. That way, youll know when to expect a decision about whether youve been approved.

<TITLE>Microloans: 13 Top U.S. Nonprofit Lenders - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Microlenders offer small loans to entrepreneurs, and many offer free consulting and other services. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. When you're a small-business owner on a quest for capital, there are several smart reasons to turn to nonprofit lenders. These lenders go beyond makingsmall loans to entrepreneursandprovide some benefits that traditional lenders dont: Profit is not their objective. Many microlenders are called mission-focused or mission-based lenders. They offer loans fromgovernment or nonprofit programs geared to helping disadvantaged communities, including areas that are struggling economically. Some microlenders also operate internationally, helpingentrepreneurs in developing nations. Microlenders typically offer loans of $50,000 or less to startups and othersmall-scale operations. Some makebigger loans to more established businesses. Many microlenders and nonprofits providepro bono consulting and training, includinghelping small businesses build credit.  MORE: Where to find startup business loans Below, welist 13 sources for nonprofit financing. They include the top lenders based on information from two major small-business institutions, the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Aspen Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based policy and educational research nonprofit. When considering these lenders, keep in mind that microloans have limitations. Because many nonprofits rely on grants, donations or government guarantees or allocations, the number of loans they offer and the amount you can borrow are limited. Funding constraints can also mean strict borrower requirements. And many nonprofits operate only in specific states or regions. Nonprofit microlenders are also grappling with a major trend in small-business financing: the rapid rise of online lending. It offers quicker but usually more expensive access to cash, says Steven Cohen, president of Excelsior Growth Fund, a New York-based community development lender. You see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost, he says. But you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isnt a whole lot of transparency. Nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, Were here. ... Were more affordable.  The Aspen Institutes FIELD program runs the U.S. Microenterprise Census, which collects data from microlenders across the country. Here are the top five microlenders by total loan amount disbursed, according to the programs 2014 survey, the most recent data available. Grameen America is affiliated with the Grameen Foundation, aninternational organization known for programs that help poor communities address their own needs. Grameen America has disbursed more than $490 million in loans to tens of thousands of women in the U.S. The organization has a nontraditional lending system: Borrowers must form a group with four other women they trust. That group then participates in a week of financial training, at the end of whicheach member opens a savings account and receives a $1,500 microloan to build a small business. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $100.7 million San Antonio-based LiftFund offers microloans in the southern U.S., including Texas, Georgia and Florida. Borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies. The microloans are also meant to help small-business owners improve their credit andmore likely to qualify for a bank loan in the future, the lender says on its website. LiftFundgot a boost in October 2016 when JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced almost$5 million in funding for its newsmall-business loan program in New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $18.7 million California-based Opportunity Fund has been serving residents of the state since 1994, with more than $160 million in microloans. Its borrowers have amedianhousehold income of $31,000 per year. Around 90% are minority-owned businesses, and about 30% are women-owned businesses. Opportunity Fund also provides financial literacy education to business owners. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $17.7 million Accion New Mexico offers small-business loans from$1,000 to$1 million in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Texas. The nonprofit also provides business counseling and marketing support and sponsors educational events.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Certain hard-hit businesses are eligible to receive a second PPP loan under the new COVID relief package. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. Small businesses hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic can receive a second forgivable loan under the newly revived Paycheck Protection Program. The application for "second-draw" loans opened to all eligible borrowerson Jan. 19. The deadline to apply is May 31, 2021. Congress designated $137 billion for PPP second draw loans as part of a larger funding and relief package. The bill, signed into law on Dec. 27, includes a total of $284.5 billion for PPP loans.Businesses that need help beyond their initial loan can receive a second loan if they can show substantial revenue decline and meet other requirements detailed below. PPP has exhausted its funds, but other lenders may be able to assist you. See options with Fundera by NerdWallet. Heres everything we know about second-draw PPP loans. If you or your business received an initial PPP loan, you may qualify for a second round of funding, provided you meet the following requirements: Have no more than 300 employees. Have used or will use the full amount of your first PPP loan. Can show a drop of at least 25% in annual gross receipts or for any quarter of 2020, compared with the same quarter in 2019. Have not permanently closed. Businesses that have temporarily closed or suspended operations can receive a second-draw loan. Second-draw PPP loans are available to businesses, certain nonprofits, self-employed individuals, independent contractors, sole proprietors, housing cooperatives, small agricultural cooperatives, veterans organizations and tribal businesses. Businesses that receive a Save Our Stages grant cannot receive additional PPP loans. The formula for second-draw PPP loans is similar to that of initial loans: Borrowers can receive up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll costs. Average monthly payroll costs can be calculated using one of the following: The 12 months prior to the loan. Calendar year 2019. Calendar year 2020. Seasonal businesses (typically operating for less than seven months in a calendar year) and new businesses in operation on Feb. 15, 2020, but not open for a full 12 months, will use a separate formula to calculate average monthly payroll. Seasonal businesses: Average total monthly payroll for any 12-week period between Feb. 15, 2019, and Feb. 15, 2020. New businesses: Total payroll costs divided by the number of months those costs were paid out. Hotels, restaurants and other accommodation and food service businesses can borrow up to 3.5 times their average monthly payroll costs. Unlike initial loans, the maximum amount for second-draw PPP loans is just $2 million. First-time PPP loans max out at $10 million.  MORE: Coronavirus relief for small businesses and the self-employed Second-draw funds are forgivable, provided they are spent on covered costs, including: Payroll costs, including paid sick leave and group insurance benefits provided by the employer. Operating costs, including payments for mortgage, rent, utilities, software, and human resources and accounting needs. Property damage sustained during protests and disturbances in 2020, unless covered by insurance. Payments to a supplier covering contracts and purchase orders in effect before taking out the second-draw loan. Personal protective equipment and modification made to meet health and safety requirements. At least 60% of the total loan amount must be used on payroll expenses to qualify for full loan forgiveness. In order to apply for a second-draw PPP loan, businesses need to submit an application along with documents to verify payroll costs and revenue loss, such as tax forms or bank statements, by May 31, 2021. You can avoid some paperwork by using the same lender for first- and second-draw loans, provided you use payroll figures from calendar year 2019 when applying for the second loan. Check with your lender to see if it is planning to offer second-draw loans. Borrowers seeking $150,000 or less dont need to prove revenue loss when they apply for a second-draw loan but will need to do so in order to apply for loan forgiveness. Second-draw loan funds can be forgiven if they are used on covered costs within 8 to 24 weeks of receiving your loan. The exact time frame is determined when you apply for your loan. At least 60% of the total second-draw loan must be used on payroll expenses to qualify for full loan forgiveness. Up to 40% can be used on other covered expenses detailed above. Business owners who borrow $150,000 or less can submit a one-page certification that details the following: The number of employees they retained as a result of the loan. An estimate of how much of the loan was spent on payroll costs. The total loan amount. Proof of qualifying revenue loss, if not already provided to the lender. Business owners who borrow more than $150,000 will complete the same forgiveness process required for their first PPP loan. If you fall into that category, youll need documentation to show how the money was spent. This could include: Payroll expenses and headcount: Tax forms, canceled checks, bank statements, payment receipts and third-party payroll reports. Operating costs: Receipts for business software, accounting services, utility payments and rental, lease or mortgage payments. Supplier costs: Purchase orders, contracts and receipts for payments made to vendors. Other covered expenses: Proof of payment for health and safety modifications, such as sneeze guards, ventilation systems, expanded outdoor space and equipment to perform health screening; receipts for the purchase of face masks and other personal protective equipment.

<TITLE>What Is Collateral? A Lien? Business Loans Lingo to Know - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. If youre considering taking out a small-business loan, you have two options: a secured loan or an unsecured loan. A secured small-business loan is backed by some form of collateral. An unsecured small-business loan isnt backed by collateral. Simple, right? Not always. Here are three terms you need to understand to better compare small-business loans. Collateral is an asset that a borrower pledges to a lender to secure a loan. It can be a physical asset, such as a home, business real estate or equipment; or non-physical assets, including accounts receivable or cash in the bank. Most online lenders dont require physical collateral. Many do, however, take a lien on a business assets and thats a form of collateral, too, says Mitchell Weiss, an executive-in-residence at the University of Hartford's Barney School of Business. When lenders say theyre not taking collateral, Weiss says, thats really not accurate if theyre taking a lien. A lien is a lenders way of legally enforcing its right to seize a borrowers business assets if the borrower hasnt repaid a loan. Many online lenders file Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) liens with state secretaries of state when a borrower first takes out a loan. If a business takes out multiple loans, the first lender to file a UCC lien has first priority over the business assets. The second lender to file a UCC lien cant collect until the first lender removes its lien. Lenders can file liens on specific assets, but many file blanket liens, which give them rights to any business assets necessary to recoup the unpaid loan. A business assets can include real estate, equipment, accounts receivable, money in the bank, patents and even computer code, says Molly Otter, chief investment officer at Lighter Capital, an online revenue lender for technology companies. A personal guarantee is a written agreement that a business owner signs, pledging his or her personal assets to repay a loan if the business entity cant. Personal assets can include an individuals home, car, cash and even retirement savings. A personal guarantee is cash youre willing to lose, says Ronnie Phillips, an economics professor at Colorado State University. Nobodys going to loan to you if youre not willing to invest [but] if everything is successful, you dont lose it. Personal guarantees alone dont secure a loan. However, if a lender has filed a UCC lien and has a borrowers personal guarantee, the lender has an a la carte menu of the borrowers personal and business assets, and can go after either to recoup an unpaid loan, says Kevin Hoult, an advisor at the Washington Small Business Development Center in Port Angeles, Washington. As youre comparing small-business loans, ask lenders if they require a personal guarantee or collateral, and if they file a lien on your business assets. You can always review loan agreements with a small-business advisor, such as the ones at your local Small Business Development Center or Score Association chapter, to ensure that you understand the business and personal assets youre putting at risk.
