This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Business loan types include term loans, SBA loans and business lines of credit. Compare your options. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. There are many different types of small-business loans everything from a business line of credit to invoice factoring to merchant cash advances each with its own pros and cons. The right one for your business will depend on when you need the money and what you need it for. Here are the 10 most-popular types of business loans.Loan terms, rates and qualifications vary by lender. A term loan is a common form of business financing. You get a lump sum of cash upfront, which you then repay with interest over a predetermined period. Online lenders offer term loans up to $1 million and can provide faster funding than banks that offer small-business loans. Pros: Get cash upfront to invest in your business. Typically allow you to borrow a higher amount than other types of loans. Funding is fast if you use an online lender rather than a traditional bank; typically a few days to a week versus up to several months. Cons: May require a personal guarantee or collateral an asset such as real estate or business equipment that the lender can sell if you default. Costs can vary; term loans from online lenders typically carry higher costs than those from traditional banks. Best for: Businesses looking to expand. Borrowers who have good credit and a strong business and who dont want to wait long for funding.  MORE: How to apply for a small-business loan The Small Business Administration guarantees these loans, which are offered by banks and other lenders. Repayment periods on SBA loans depend on how you plan to use the money. They range from seven years for working capital to 10 years for buying equipment and 25 years for real estate purchases. Pros: Some of the lowest rates on the market. You can borrow up to $5 million. Long repayment terms. Cons: Hard to qualify. Long and rigorous application process. Best for: Businesses looking to expand or refinance existing debts. Strong-credit borrowers who can wait a long time for funding. A business line of credit provides access to funds up to your credit limit, and you pay interest only on the money youve drawn. It can provide more flexibility than a term loan. Pros: Flexible way to borrow. Typically unsecured, so no collateral required. Cons: May carry additional costs, such as maintenance fees and draw fees. Strong revenue and credit required. Best for: Short-term financing needs, managing cash flow or handling unexpected expenses. Seasonal businesses. Equipment loanshelp you buy equipment for your business, sometimes including semi truck financing. (Business auto loans are available for cars, vans and light trucks.) An equipment loan's term typically is matched up with the expected life span of the equipment, and the equipment serves as collateral for the loan. Rates will depend on the value of the equipment and the strength of your business. Pros: You own the equipment and build equity in it. You can get competitive rates if you have strong credit and business finances. Cons: You may have to come up with a down payment. Equipment can become outdated more quickly than the length of your financing. Best for: Businesses that want to own equipment outright. Lets say your business has unpaid customer invoices, which are typically paid in 60 days. If you need cash now, you can get money for those unpaid invoices through invoice factoring. Youd sell the invoices to a factoring company, which would be responsible for collecting from the customer when the invoice is due. Pros: Fast cash for your business. Easier approval than traditional funding options. Cons: Costly compared with other options. You lose control over the collection of your invoices. Best for: Businesses with unpaid invoices that need fast cash. Businesses with reliable customers on long payment terms (30, 60 or 90 days). This is similar to invoice factoring, but instead of selling your unpaid invoices to a factoring company, you use the invoices as collateral to get a cash advance. Pros: Fast cash. Your customers wont know their invoice is being financed. Cons: Costly compared with other options. Youre still responsible for collecting the invoice payment. Best for: Businesses looking to turn unpaid invoices into fast cash. Businesses that want to maintain control over their invoices. You get a lump sum of cash upfront that you can use to finance your business. Instead of making one fixed payment each month from a bank account as you would with a term loan, you make payments on a merchant cash advanceeither by withholding a percentage of your credit and debit card sales daily, or by fixed daily or weekly withdrawals from a bank account. Pros: Fast cash. Unsecured financing. Cons: Some of the highest borrowing costs up to 350% in some cases. Frequent repayments can create cash flow problems. Best for: Businesses that have high and consistent credit card sales and can handle frequent repayments. Businesses that can't get financing anywhere else and can't wait for capital. It is possible to usea personal loan for business purposes. Its an option for startups, as banks typically don't lend to businesses with no operating history. Approval for these loans is based solely on your personal credit score, but youll need good credit to qualify. Pros: Startups and newer businesses can qualify. Fast funding. Cons: High borrowing costs. Small borrowing amounts of up to $50,000. Failure to repay can hurt your credit. Best for: Startups and newer businesses with strong personal credit. Borrowers willing to risk damaging their credit score. Business credit cards are revolving lines of credit. You can draw from and repay the card as needed, as long as you make minimum monthly payments and dont exceed the credit limit. They are typically best used for financing ongoing expenses, such as travel, office supplies and utilities. Pros: Earn rewards on your purchases. No collateral required. Cons: High cost, with a variable rate that may rise. Extra fees may apply. Best for: Ongoing business expenses. Microloans are small loans $50,000 or less offered by nonprofit organizations and mission-based lenders. These loans typically are available to startups, newer businesses and businesses in disadvantaged communities. Pros: Low cost. Other services may be provided, such as consulting and training. Cons: Smaller loan amounts. You may have to meet stringent eligibility requirements. Best for: Startups and businesses in disadvantaged communities. Businesses seeking only a small amount of financing.   Updated Disclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

NOTE: If state specific forms are not shown above, please refer to the application materials listed below to start the process of applying. Please ensure that your state is selected in the dropdown menu above to find the State Office contact information for this program and speak to a Business Programs Specialist before attempting to fill out any forms or applications. This will save you valuable time in the process. Preliminary Actions Required To complete an application for this program, you must be pre-registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) and also have a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number. Neither of these applications cost money, but they can take time so be sure to get this taken care of right away. If you are already registered with these systems, you do not need to do it again. Special Alert for SAM Registrants Last year, we alerted our vendor community to third party companies offering to help you update information contained within the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) website, for a fee. Your SAM registration contains sensitive business information, including your banking information and other sensitive information, so your login and password should not be shared with anyone outside your company. As a reminder, the use of the System for Award Management website is free to use and update, and the Commodity Procurement Staff does not see a reason to pay anyone to provide that service. Secondly, we have just become aware of a couple of scam emails that offer to help companies start the renewal process online or suggest that Your Federal Profile is Almost Complete. Immediate Action Required! In both cases, your free access to SAM.gov will resolve any questions you may have regarding your registration in SAM.gov. As you know SAM.gov requires an annual recertification and sends out email reminders prior to the expiration, and again, updates should be handled by company employees. Furthermore, if your registration is not complete, you may login to SAM.gov to make that determination for yourself. Please remember that SAM.gov is not affiliated with the USDA and is a government-wide website not maintained by our Agency. If you have any questions regarding access or how to use SAM, please contact their help desk at 866-606-8220, option #1. There are no other additional requirements at the national level.

<TITLE>PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Understand when and how to apply for PPP loan forgiveness, including what expenses are covered. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information. The Paycheck Protection Program provides fully forgivable loans to small businesses struggling through the coronavirus pandemic. But applying for that forgiveness can be daunting, especially for business owners who have limited resources at their disposal. PPP has exhausted its funds, but other lenders may be able to assist you. See options with Fundera by NerdWallet. There is good news: Businesses that borrowed $150,000 or less can now use a simplified loan forgiveness application that doesn't require any additional documentation for first-draw borrowers. For context, 87% of PPP loans issued through Aug. 8, 2020, when the first round closed, were less than $150,000. We've put together a guide to help business owners better understand the PPP loan forgiveness process. Loan forgiveness requirements are the same for first- and second-draw PPP loans. To receive full loan forgiveness, you need to maintain staffing and compensation levels during the covered period. Additionally, money from your PPP loan must be spent on eligible expenses (see below) during the covered period. In order for your loan to be fully forgiven, at least 60% must be spent on payroll costs. The covered period for most loans made in 2020 is 24 weeks after your loan is disbursed, but borrowers with loans issued before June 5, 2020, may opt for the original eight-week period. Business owners receiving a first- or second-draw loan in 2021 can opt for a covered period from eight to 24 weeks. Eligible expenses were originally limited to payroll and operating costs, but the coronavirus relief bill passed in December 2020 expanded the list to include supplier costs, expenses related to health and safety enhancements and some property damage. The following types of expenses now qualify for PPP loan forgiveness: Payroll costs: This includes all wages paid, including tips, commissions and bonuses as well employer-paid benefits such as insurance, sick leave and retirement contributions. Compensation for employees earning more than $100,000 per year aren't eligible for forgiveness. Operating costs: This includes mortgage payments and interest, rent, utilities and business software, such as accounting, payroll or inventory management programs. Supplier costs: The cost of goods essential to operating your business is eligible for forgiveness if the purchase order or contract was in place before the covered period. Purchase orders for perishable goods made during the covered period are also eligible. Property damage:This is for repairs for damage or loss due to looting, specifically related to public disturbances in 2020. Costs covered by insurance aren't eligible. Worker protection: This includes personal protective equipment and other costs related to health and safety requirements, such as health screenings, installation of barriers or expansion of outdoor dining. A few nuances to note: Costs incurred before the covered period, but paid during the covered period, are eligible for forgiveness. As are costs incurred during the covered period but paid after it ends, provided they are paid on or before the next regular payroll or billing date. You can apply for PPP loan forgiveness as soon as youve spent the funds or as late as when your loan matures. But, ideally, youd do so before you have to make a single payment. Payments on PPP loans are deferred for 10 months after the covered period (eight to 24 weeks) ends. Youll need to start making loan payments if you apply for forgiveness after this date. Borrowers aren't eligible for forgiveness if they apply after their loan matures, which is two years for loans originated before June 5, 2020, and five years for loans issued after that date. Contact your PPP lender when youre ready to apply for forgiveness. They can direct you to the correct loan forgiveness form. Youll need to submit that along with paperwork showing how you spent your loan. Collecting this paper trail as you go will make it easier to apply for forgiveness. See below for the types of documentation you may need to provide. Business owners who borrowed less than $150,000 for their first-draw loan can use a simplified form and don't need to submit additional documentation. For second-draw loans, borrowers need to show the required revenue loss before their loan can be forgiven. Along with your loan forgiveness application, you will need to provide proof of how you spent your PPP loan. Remember, only funds spent on allowable expenses will be forgiven. And at least 60% of your loan must be spent on payroll costs to qualify for full forgiveness. Below is a list of documents to submit with your PPP loan forgiveness application. Note: This list isn't exhaustive, and not all documents will be needed for all businesses. Payroll costs Third-party payroll reports. State and local quarterly financial reports. State unemployment insurance filings. Bank statements Tax documents: Form 1040 Schedule C or Schedule F, Form 1065 Schedule K-1, Form 941, Form 944, Form W-2, Form W-3. Payment receipts, canceled checks or account statements showing employer health and retirement contributions. Other costs Account statements. Utility bills reflecting payments made. Purchase orders, contracts and receipts for vendor payments. Canceled checks or receipts for covered expenses, such as business software, protective equipment, safety modifications and repairs for damage sustained during summer protests.

Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. This free, interest-earning account is well-suited for small-business owners who prefer to manage their finances online. Editor's note, April 9, 2021: BlueVine has currently paused new business checking account applications. Small-business owners can visit the BlueVine website to join the waitlist and be notified when applications resume. With no fees and unlimited transactions, BlueVines business checking account includes features that are common with online-only banks. The account stands out, however, because BlueVine allows you to earn interest on your account without having to maintain a monthly or daily balance requirement. Unlike the majority of online-only accounts, you also have the ability to make cash deposits. Want a free business checking account that earns interest.

Monthly fee: $0 Minimum opening deposit requirement: $0 APY: 1% on balances up to $100,000 Transactions: Unlimited Bonus: None BlueVine is best known as an alternative lender that provides business financing. This business checking account is now offered in addition toBlueVine small-business loans. As BlueVine is not a bank, its banking services are provided by The Bancorp Bank, and all accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. up to $250,000. You can apply for and open a BlueVine business checking account entirely online. To be eligible, you must be at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen or a resident with a valid address. To sign up for BlueVine business banking, youll be asked to create an online account and provide basic details and documentation about you and your business. Generally, applications are reviewed within 24 hours; however, the process may take anywhere from three to five business days. After you receive approval from BlueVine, youll need to accept the account agreement and then youll be able to fund and access your account. Youll also receive your BlueVine business debit card in five to seven business days. Once youve deposited $1 into your BlueVine business checking account, youll start earning 1% interest on your account balance, up to and including $100,000. Overall, youll be able to manage your account using the online dashboard as well as using the BlueVine mobile app, available for both Android and iOS.

In addition, this account includes unlimited fee-free transactions and fee-free ATM access at any MoneyPass location across the U.S. High-yield APY: BlueVine Business Checking earns a 1% annual percentage yield on all balances up to $100,000 and, unlike most interest-earning accounts, does not require that you maintain a daily or monthly minimum balance to do so. Cash deposits: Through BlueVines partnership with third-party service Green Dot, you can use your business debit card to deposit up to $7,500 in cash per month at over 90,000 locations throughout the U.S. Some of BlueVines competitors cannot accommodate cash deposits.

No branch access: As an online-only business checking account, BlueVine does not include access to a physical branch. Although its account features overlap with those offered by many traditional brick-and-mortar banks, the ability to visit a branch can create a more personal customer experience. Fee for cash deposits: Youll be charged a $4.95 fee each time you deposit cash into your BlueVine account. Although BlueVine stands out among online-only business checking accounts for its ability to accommodate cash deposits, these fees can quickly add up if your business deals frequently in cash. No joint accounts: BlueVine only allows a single user to be attached to an individual business checking account, which could be problematic for larger or multi-owner businesses. While some checking accounts issue business debit cards that can be used by employees or additional business owners, the BlueVine business checking account issues a single card.

Two new laws provide coronavirus relief for small businesses, including deferment of existing SBA loans, access to loans and immediate emergency funds, and debt forgiveness.A second round of government-backed forgivable coronavirus relief loans is expected to reopen in early January 2021 after President Trump signed a bill reauthorizing $284.5 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Online lenders offer term loans up to $500,000, while loans backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration provide up to $5 million. Your borrowing limit depends mainly on the size and age of your business. It can be hard to get a small-business loan if you have a bad personal credit score (300 to 629 FICO), low annual revenue and no business history. Build your credit scores, develop a strong business plan and secure the loan with collateral to qualify for a business loan.

<TITLE>Business Line of Credit: How It Works and Best Options 2021</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Work with our lending specialists to get smart answers to all your small business questions. Best of all, its completely free. Best Of Online lenders offer business lines of credit up to $250,000 for short-term financing needs. When you need to manage cash flow, buy inventory or pay for an unexpected expense, then a business line of credit can help. A business line of credit is a type ofsmall-business loanthat provides more flexibility than a regular business loan. Business owners can borrow as needed up to their limit, which can range from $1,000 to $250,000. And business lines of credit with lower credit limits are often unsecured, which means collateral such as real estate or inventory is not required. with Fundera by Nerdwallet Our pick for Business lines of credit up to $100,000 OnDeck offers business lines of credit up to $100,000 for short-term financing needs. with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 11.00 - 61.90% 600 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: Our pick for Business lines of credit up to $250,000 with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 15.00 - 78.00% 650 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet OnDeck - Line of credit with Fundera by Nerdwallet BlueVine - Line of credit with Fundera by Nerdwallet A line of credit works similarly to a credit card. With a line of credit, you can draw funds as needed and repay them over time. You can keep reusing and repaying your line of credit as often as youd like, as long as you make payments on time and dont exceed your credit limit. You pay interest only on the portion of money that you borrow, and most lenders allow you to repay your full balance early to save on interest costs. A business line of credit differs from aterm loan, which provides a one-time lump sum of cash upfront, repaid over a fixed period, or term. Line of credit borrowing limits ranging from $1,000 to $250,000 are usually smaller than term loans. At a minimum, youll need at least six months in business and $25,000 in annual revenue to qualify for a business line of credit. Although not all lenders set a minimum credit score, borrowers most likely will need a score of 500 or higher to qualify. Business lines of credit are issued by traditional lenders, like banks, as well as online lenders like OnDeck and BlueVine. Interest rates and borrowing limits can vary widely depending on the lenders requirements and the borrowers circumstances. When you apply for a business line of credit, lenders typically require documentation including personal and business tax returns, bank account information and business financial statements, such as profit-and-loss statements and a balance sheet. Most traditional lenders require businesses to have strong revenue and several years of history to qualify for a line of credit. Larger lines of credit may require collateral, which can be seized by the lender if you fail to make payments.SBA lines of credit have similarly strict requirements. Online lenders typically have looser qualification requirements than banks. However, these lenders are also likely to charge higher rates than banks and may have lower credit limits. After approval, lenders may be able to issue business lines of credit in a matter of days. Banks generally take longer than online lenders to set up new lines of credit. A secured business line of credit means you are putting up assets such as inventory or property as collateral. If you fail to pay back the credit line, a lender could seize your assets. Obtaining an unsecured business credit line doesnt require collateral, but some lenders may still require a personal guarantee or a lien on a business assets. A personal guarantee gives a lender the right to go after your personal assets, such as a house, if you default on a loan. A lien is similar; a lender can seize your business assets if you havent repaid a loan. When comparing lenders, ask whether they require a collateral, personal guarantee or a lien so that you can find the option thats best for your business. Business credit cards are also lines of credit, but differ from a traditional business line of credit in several ways. A business line of credit provides a higher credit limit, may be secured by collateral and provides actual cash to your bank account when you make a draw. You can get cash through a business credit card, but youll be charged fees and a higher APR to do so. Other common fees for business credit cards include annual fees and late-payment fees. Business credit cards work best for smaller ongoing expenses and for newer businesses without established finances, while a business line of credit works best for larger ongoing expenses and more mature businesses. Just like personal credit cards, business credit cards can provide rewards or cash back for spending. Rewards are typically related to business expenses, such as office supplies, gas, internet and cable. They may also offer 0% interest promotions, which allow you to pay no interest on your balance for a specific time period after signing up for the card. To recap our selections... A business line of credit works best when you need to finance short-term expenses, such as replenishing inventory or covering unexpected costs. A small-business term loan finances large one-time expenses, like equipment purchase. Online lenders, banks and credit unions offer business lines of credit. Banks and credit unions typically require strong business revenue and at least a few years of history to qualify. Online lenders have looser qualifications, but may charge higher rates. Compare your options to find the one that best fits your financing needs. For newer businesses, it can be difficult to get a small-business line of credit. Traditional lenders, such as banks, typically require businesses to have several years of operations, revenue and strong finances to secure any type of financing.

Knowing the steps to getting a business loan can help reduce frustration and increase your chances of approval. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. A business loan can help you start or grow your company, but navigating the loan process, as well as tightened lending standards, can be intimidating. Breaking it down to manageable steps from qualifications to shopping for lenders and applying for a small-business loan can help you secure the funding your business needs. Here's how to get a business loan in five simple steps. Answer these questions to help determine whether you mightqualify for a small-business loan: You can get your credit report for free from each of the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. You can also get your credit score for free from several credit card issuers and personal finance websites, including NerdWallet. Banks prefer to offer their low-rate business loans to borrowers with credit scores above 680 at least, says Suzanne Darden, a finance specialist at the Alabama Small Business Development Center. If your credit score falls below that threshold, considersmall-business loans for borrowers with bad credit or loans from a nonprofit microlender. Lenders will consider how long your business has been operating. You need to have been in business at least one year to qualify for most online small-business loans and at least two years to qualify for most bank loans. Many lenders require a minimum annual revenue, which can range anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000. Calculate your revenue and find out the minimum a given lender requires before you apply. Look carefully at your businesss financials especially cash flow and evaluate how much you can afford to apply toward loan repayments each month. Some online lenders require daily repayments, so make sure to factor that in. To comfortably repay your loan each month, your total income should be at least 1.25 times your total expenses, including your new repayment amount, Darden says. For example, say your businesss income is $10,000 a month and you already pay $7,000 toward rent, payroll and other costs. According to this rule, you should be able to afford a $1,000 monthly loan payment since $10,000 is 1.25 times $8,000 of total expenses. You can get secured and unsecured business loans from many lenders. A secured loan requires business collateral, such as property or equipment, that the lender can seize if you fail to repay the loan. Putting up collateral is risky, but it can also raise the amount lenders let you borrow and get you a lower interest rate. Lenders may also require a personal guarantee even for unsecured loans. This means you'll personally repay the loan if your business can't, and may let a lender come after things like your house or car in instances of nonpayment. Lenders will ask why you need to get a small-business loan. Your answer will likely fall into one of three categories and determine which type of business loan is right for you: You want to start a business. Lenders require cash flow to support repayment of the loan, so companies in their first year typically can't get business loans.Instead, youll have to rely on other types of startup financing, like business credit cards and personal loans. You want to manage day-to-day expenses.Abusiness line of creditcould make sense. This flexible kind of funding lets you tap into financing as needed to cover expenses like payroll or unexpected costs like repairs, offering a useful safety net as needed You want to grow your business.Considera government-backed SBA loan or traditional term loan, which often have higher borrowing maximums SBA loans can reach $5.5 million, for example. Many lenders also offer specific products to fit a growing company's needs, such as loans for equipment or vehicle purchases. There are three main sources for getting small-business loans: online lenders, banks and nonprofit microlenders. Each typically has multiple products, but one may be better in certain instances than others. You lack collateral. You lack time in business. You need funding quickly. Online lenders provide small-business loans and lines of credit from about $1,000 to $5 million. The average annual percentage rate on these loans ranges from 6% to 99%, depending on the lender, the type and size of the loan, the length of the repayment term, the borrowers credit history and whether collateral is required. These lenders rarely have APRs as low as those at traditional banks, but approval rates are higher and funding is faster than with banks as fast as 12 hours. You've been in business at least two years. You have good credit. You don't need cash fast. Traditional bank options include term loans, lines of credit and commercial mortgages to buy properties or refinance. Through banks, the U.S. Small Business Administration provides general small-business loans with its 7(a) loan program, short-term microloans and disaster loans. The SBA provides loans up to $5.5 million, with 7(a) loans averaging $533,075 in fiscal year 2020, according to the Congressional Research Service. The average SBA microloan is $13,000. Taking out a small-business loan from a bank can be tough due to factors like lower sales volume and cash reserves. Add bad personal credit or no collateral to that, and many small-business owners come up empty-handed. Getting funded takes longer than other options, but banks are usually the lowest-APR option. You have bad credit or no credit history. You are a new business. You can't get a traditional loan. Microlenders are nonprofits that typically lend short-term loans of less than $50,000. The APR on these loans is typically higher than that of bank loans. The application may require a detailed business plan, financial statements and a description of what the loan will be used for, making it a lengthy process. Also, the size of the loans is, by definition, micro. But these loans may work well for smaller companies or startups that cant qualify for traditional bank loans due to a limited operating history, poor personal credit or a lack of collateral. Accion Opportunity Fund, Kiva and Accompany Capital are just a few examples of microlenders. Before you apply, make sure you have all the required documentation. Locating these files now and having them easily accessible will help streamline the process of getting a small-business loan. Depending on the lender, youll need to submit a combination of the following: Business and personal tax returns. Business and personal bank statements. Business financial statements. Business legal documents (e.g., articles of incorporation, commercial lease, franchise agreement). Business plan. You made it! Now that youve determined which type of loan and lender are right for you, it's time to apply. Start by looking at two or three similar options based on loan terms and annual percentage rate, or APR. Because APR includes all loan fees in addition to the interest rate, it's the best way to understand the total cost of a business loan for the year.  MORE: Compare small-business lenders Of the loans you qualify for, choose the one with the lowest APR (as long as youre able to handle the loans regular payments), and apply with the documents youve gathered. Note that credit bureaus dont differentiate between business and personal inquiries. If you use your personal credit history, your credit score could be affected when applying for a small business loan, which is why its important to go with your best bet. You will need a strong personal credit score, solid business financials, such as revenue, at least a year in business and in some cases collateral to qualify for a small-business loan at a bank. Online lenders require less stringent requirements. If you're just starting out, consider alternatives such as business credit cards. See our list of startup funding options. It can be challenging to qualify for a small-business loan without a strong personal score (starting around 700) and a solid cash flow from your business. Those are among common reasons why your business loan application can be denied. Updated Disclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

If youre in the market for a small-business loan, using a business loan calculator can help you determine the loans affordability before you apply. Enter the loan amount, loan term and estimated annual percentage rate to find out your monthly payments and total interest costs. Then viewbusiness loan options based on your credit score. Monthly payment: This is the fixed amount youll repay each month and includes principal, interest and fees. Total payments:This is the sum of all the payments to be made on the loan, which includesthe amount you've borrowed, plusinterest and fees. Total interest paid:The total interest paid represents what the lender is charging you forthe loan. If you repay early, you may be able to save on interest. APR: This number represents the true annual cost of the loan and makes it easier to do an apples-to-apples comparison between products. Some lenders do not provide APR and instead give a general interest rate that does not include any fees. APR for business loans depends on your credit score and your businesss finances, including annual revenue and time in business. Business loans stretch up to 10 years or longer, but youll likely need to have an established business with strong finances to qualify for such loans. Online lenders typically charge business loan rates between 6% to 99% APR. Youll likely find the lowest rates through SBA 7(a) loans, whichare set based on the daily prime rate plus a lender spread. The difficulty in getting a business loan depends on factors that include where you get the loan, the strength of your credit score and the businesss finances, and whether youre prepared to apply.

<TITLE>PPP 2.0: How to Apply for a New PPP Loan - NerdWallet</TITLE>

We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us.

Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. The Paycheck Protection Program helps small businesses with payroll and operating costs. Learn how PPP works. Updated 5/27/21:The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends on May 31, 2021. While lenders have until June 30 to finish processing approved loans, new PPP loan applications will not be accepted after the program expires. Congress extended the PPP deadline on March 25, giving small-business owners until May 31 to apply for a first- orsecond-draw loanthrough the Paycheck Protection Program.But the Small Business Administration stopped accepting most new applications on May 4 when the general fund for PPP loans ran out of money. Community financial institutions were still able to process new applications thanks to funding set aside for these lenders, which service underserved communities. PPP has exhausted its funds, but other lenders may be able to assist you. See options with Fundera by NerdWallet. Here is what we know about the latest round of PPP. First-time loans can go to a wider array of borrowers, provided they were in business on Feb. 15, 2020. Eligibility will now include news outlets with no more than 500 employees per location. In addition, 501(c)(6) nonprofits and destination marketing organizations may be eligible if they meet limits on lobbying and size. Sole proprietors, self-employed workers and independent contractors or side gig workers are also eligible. Publicly traded companies are excluded from the latest PPP round. Some funding is now set aside to help specific struggling groups: Grants to live entertainment venues and organizations, museums and movies theaters that demonstrate a 25% reduction in revenues. Grant recipients cannot also get a PPP loan. Loans made through community financial institutions and some small depository institutions. Money for borrowers with 10 or fewer employees and to provide loans under $250,000 in low-income areas. Changes announced on Feb. 22, 2021 remove additional restrictions, so business owners with delinquent federal student loans or non-fraud felony convictions are now eligible for PPP loans. The new authorization provides funding for a second PPP loan for eligible businesses. Second loans can go to previous borrowers if they have no more than 300 employees and can show a 25% drop in gross receipts in any 2020 quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019. First-time loans continue to be capped at 2.5 times average monthly payroll costs, with a maximum of $10 million. Second PPP loans have a $2 million maximum and generally use the 2.5 times average monthly payroll guideline. But the hard-hit accommodation and food service industries can borrow up to 3.5 times average monthly payroll costs. On Feb. 22, 2021, the Biden administration announced changes to the loan calculation formula for self-employed professionals, many of whom only qualified for a small amount or were excluded entirely from previous rounds. The new formula uses gross income instead of net profit. But the SBA didnt start accepting applications using the new formula until March 5. Since there was no directive to make the changes retroactive, borrowers who received a PPP loan before that date are stuck with a much lower loan amount and no recourse to change it. For all loans, allowable expenses have been expanded to include operations items like software; supplier costs; protective equipment and workplace modifications to meet health guidelines; and damage due to 2020 public disturbances that's not covered by insurance. The bill clarifies that group insurance benefits provided by an employer are considered payroll costs, including group life, disability, vision, or dental insurance. PPP loans continue to cover payroll and operating costs such as rent and utilities. The loans are being offered at a 1% fixed rate interest. You arent required to put up collateral for the loans, and there are no application fees. Business owners need to fill out a PPP loan application SBA Form 2483 for first-draw loans and SBA Form 2483-SD for second-draw loans and gather all supporting documents. You can apply for a new PPP loan through any participating lender. Keep in mind: Some banks prioritize current account holders, so if you have a relationship with a bank offering PPP loans, apply there first. The deadline to apply is March 31, 2021 A few fintech companies and online lenders, such as BlueVine, are approved to accept PPP loan applications. These companies typically offer a streamlined loan application process and may be able to approve loans and deliver funding more quickly than traditional banks. The new PPP authorization creates a simplified forgiveness process for borrowers who received loans less than $150,000. PPP funds used on payroll costs, rent, utilities and mortgage interest in the 8 to 24 weeks after receiving the loan are forgivable. This means you wont be required to repay that portion of the loan. But you must have spent at least 60% on payroll costs and no more than 40% on nonpayroll costs in order to receive full forgiveness. The Paycheck Protection Program was created on March 27, 2020, as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as CARES, to help small businesses keep employees on the payroll. The program's primary tool is forgivable loans intended to make paying employees easier during the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The SBA guarantees PPP loans, while banks and other financial institutions underwrite and issue them. The first PPP round opened on April 3 but the $349 billion in initial funding was depleted in weeks. An additional $310 billion in funding was signed into law in late April, and applications closed on Aug. 8. The bill extends payment of principal and interest on loans guaranteed by the SBA as part of the 7(a), 504 and microloan programs. The bill also increases the guarantee to 90% for the SBAs signature 7(a) loans until Oct. 1, 2021.

<TITLE>Merchant Cash Advance Calculator: Find True Cost of an MCA - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Use this MCA calculator to determine the total cost of your merchant cash advance, including fees and interest. A merchant cash advance is not a small-business loan; rather, its a cash advance in exchange for a cut of your future business sales. Instead of making monthly installment payments over a set period of time, you make daily or weekly payments, plus fees, until the merchant cash advance is paid in full. MCAs often carry triple-digit annual percentage rates, or APRs, which represent the total cost of a loan, including interest and fees. And the daily or weekly repayment schedule can cause cash flow problems for your business if your sales tend to be erratic or you hit a rough patch. Using an MCA calculator can help you determine the total cost of borrowing and whether a merchant cash advance makes sense for your business. Merchant cash advance amount: Enter the total MCA youre borrowing. Payback terms: If you know your factor rate, select that option. The factor rate typically ranges from 1.2 to 1.5. A higher factor rate corresponds to higher fees youll pay on the merchant cash advance. In the factor rate field, enter that number. If you dont know your factor rate, select total payback amount and enter the amount in the next field. Payment is based on: Select either monthly credit/debit card sales or fixed daily payment. If you choose monthly credit/debit card sales, enter your estimated monthly credit or debit card sales in the next field. In the percent of monthly credit/debit card sales field, enter the percentage amount (example 10%) that the merchant cash advance provider will deduct from your monthly credit or debit cards until the total borrowed amount is repaid. If you choose fixed daily payment, enter the amount you expect to repay daily in the next field. The approximate daily payment of: This is the amount you can expect to pay daily until your MCA is paid back in full. For the period of: This is how long itll take to repay the MCA. A total payback amount of: This is the total amount that youll pay for financing, including fees. With an effective APR of: This is the total annual percentage rate of interest youll pay on the borrowed amount per year.

<TITLE>SBA Loans: What They Are and How to Qualify - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. An SBA loan is a small-business loan offered by banks and online lenders, and partly guaranteed by the government. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. SBA loans are small-business loanspartially guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration and issued by participating lenders, usually banks. SBA loans have tight lending standards, but their flexible terms and low interest rates can make them one of the best ways tofinance a business. Here's what to know about SBA loans and how to maximize your chances of approval. An SBA loan is a type of government small-business loanthat's issued by private lenders but backed by the federal government. The SBA has several loan programs, including 7(a) loans, 504 loans and microloans (more on these below). You apply for an SBA loan via a lending institution like a bank or credit union. That lender then applies to the SBA for a loan guarantee, which means if you default on an SBA loan, the government pays the lender the guaranteed amount. The SBA requires an unconditional personal guarantee as business collateral from everyone with at least 20% ownership in a company. This guarantee puts you and your personal assets on the hook for payments if your business can't make them. The latest coronavirus relief bill has temporarily changed some SBA loan features to promote lending and assist borrowers. The following changes are on top of additionalrelief programs for small businesses, such as the Paycheck Protection Program andEconomic Injury Disaster Loans, and went into effect Feb. 1: Loan limits increased. As of Jan. 1, 2021, the borrowing limit for SBA Express loans was increased from $350,000 to $1 million. That maximum will permanently drop to$500,000 on Oct. 1, 2021. Fees waived. For 7(a) and 504 loans, the SBA will eliminate feesfor both lenders and borrowers. Loan guarantees increased.Until Oct. 1, 2021, the SBA will guarantee 90% of loans from its 7(a) program and 75% for SBA Express loans of more than $350,000.The maximum SBA guarantee is usually 85% for loans up to $150,000, 75% for loans greater than $150,000 and 50% for Express loans. Payments covered. The government will make monthly payments of up to $9,000 on eligible SBA loans. The number of payments you can receive will depend on when your loan was approved, issued or disbursed. The SBA provided updated guidance on Feb. 16, 2021, regarding payment relief options for eligible 7(a) and 504 loans: For loans approved prior to March 27, 2020: Two months paid, and those in select industries hit hardest by the pandemic may receive three months on top of that. For loans approved between March 27 and Sept. 27, 2020, and disbursed on or after Sept. 28, 2020: Three months paid. For loans approved between March 27 and Sept. 27, 2020, and fully disbursed before Sept. 27, 2020: The SBA will cover six months of payments. For loans approved between Feb. 1 and Sept. 30, 2021: Three payments covered. Payments are subject to the availability of funds, so the number covered may change in the future. There are multiple types of SBA loans each with its own terms and conditions. The best SBA loan for you will depend on what you plan to use the funding for. Program Loan size Purpose SBA 7(a) loans Up to $5 million Working capital, expansion and equipment purchases SBA Express loans Up to $1 million (drops to $500,000 on Oct. 1, 2021) Fast funding for working capital, expansion and real estate and equipment purchases SBA 504 loans Up to $5.5 million Purchase long-term, fixed assets like land, machinery and facilities SBA microloans Up to $50,000 Working capital, inventory, supplies, equipment and machinery SBA disaster loans Up to $2 million Repair physical damage due to a declared disaster and cover operating expenses SBA Community Advantage loans Up to $250,000 Normal business purposes; cannot be used for revolving credit SBA export working capital loans Up to $5 million Working capital to support export sales SBA export express loans Up to $500,000 Expedited funding to enhance a businesss export development SBA international trade loans Up to $5 million Long-term funding to expand export sales or modernize to contend with foreign competitors The SBA also offers funding via small-business grants and loan programs for veterans.  MORE: SBA line of credit: How it works and how to qualify Per federal rules, participating lenders base SBA loan interest rateson the prime rate plus a markup rate known as the spread. Note that the APR on a loan is different from the interest rate. The APR is a percentage that includes all loan fees in addition to the interest rate. APRs can vary substantially between SBA lenders and non-SBA lenders. For example, an online lender that specializes in SBA loans may cap its APR around 10%, while major online small-business lenders that don't offer SBA loans have loans with APRs as high as 99%. Fees for SBA loans usually consist of an upfront guarantee fee, based on the loan amount and the maturity of the loan, and a yearly service fee, based on the guaranteed portion of the outstanding balance. The SBA reassesses its fee structure each year. Fees are SBA loans are currently being waived. Another perk of SBA loans is that you get more time to repay them, which means youll have more money available for other business needs. The loan term will depend on how you plan to use the money. The current maximum maturities are: Working capital or inventory loan: 10 years. Equipment: 10 years. Real estate: 25 years. To qualify for an SBA loan, lenders typically like to see at least two years in business, strong annual revenue and a good credit score, which starts around 690. If your business is struggling, an SBA loan is probably out of the question. And if it falls into any of theineligible categories, such as charitable and religious institutions, you shouldnt apply.  MORE: 5 reasons you might not meet SBA loan requirements If you think you qualify, the best place to start is the SBA website, which includes a loan application checklist. Use this to gather your documents, including your tax returns and business records. Here are some of the documents you will need before applying: SBAs borrower information form. Statement of personal history. Personal financial statement. Personal income tax returns. Business tax returns. Business license. Lease agreement if applicable. One-year cash flow projection. The SBA offers a convenient Lender Match tool to match potential borrowers with lenders within two days. If youre applying through a traditional bank, it helps to work with one that has a track record of processing SBA loans. Ask your potential lender these questions: How many SBA loans do you make? How often do you fund SBA loans? How experienced is your staff in the process? What is the dollar range of the loans you make? In general, a bank with multiple years of SBA experience will be able to better guide you, including letting you know your chances of being approved.Banks will follow SBA guidelines but use their own underwriting criteria to evaluate loan applications. As an example, Live Oak Bank based in Wilmington, North Carolina, is the most active SBA 7(a) lender in the United States by lending volume. Loan amounts range from $75,000 to $5 million. To qualify, you must be in good financial standing and able to show personal and business tax returns for the past three years. The time it takes to get approved for an SBA loan will depend on the lender you choose. With a bank, the entire process from approval to funding can take from 30 days to a couple of months. Short on time? The SBA has another financing program called SBA Express, which aims to respond to loan applications within 36 hours. The maximum amount for this type of financing is temporarily set at $1,000,000, and the maximum amount the SBA could guarantee is 75%. Once your application is approved, your lender is responsible for closing the loan and disbursing the loan proceeds. You repay the lender directly, usually on a monthly basis.

<TITLE>4 Best Business Loans for Bad Credit of June 2021</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Work with our lending specialists to get smart answers to all your small business questions. Best of all, its completely free. Best Of Online lenders provide small-business loans for borrowers with bad credit. Rates may be higher than bank loans. Bad credit small-business loans are available from alternative sources, like online lenders. If your credit isnt great, getting a loan from a bank or credit union may be difficult. Borrowers with poor credit are considered riskier, so available loans will likely be more expensive as a result. If you need a bad credit business loan, shop around to get the best terms possible and make sure the payments will be manageable. Here are loans for borrowers with bad credit defined by FICO as a score between 300 and 629 and more information on how to qualify for financing. with Fundera by Nerdwallet Our picks for 600+ personal credit score Additional options may be available once your credit reaches 600, including term loans with higher borrowing amounts. with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 15.00 - 78.00% 650 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 11.00 - 61.90% 600 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 9.00 - 99.00% 600 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: Our pick for Businesses with unpaid customer invoices Invoice factoring can turn your unpaid customer invoices into immediate cash. Approval typically depends on the strength of your customers such as whether they pay on time not your personal credit. with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 15.00 - 68.00% 530 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet BlueVine - Line of credit with Fundera by Nerdwallet OnDeck - Line of credit with Fundera by Nerdwallet OnDeck - Online term loan with Fundera by Nerdwallet BlueVine - Invoice factoring with Fundera by Nerdwallet Its possible to get a business loan with bad credit if your company is otherwise in good shape. Lenders have different qualifications, and are likely to consider the following in addition to your credit score: The reasons behind your low credit score may also influence a lenders decision. For example, it will likely be harder to get approved if a recent bankruptcy or loan default is whats dragging your score down. Banks and credit unions likely wont approve you if you have bad credit. But these alternative sources may let you get a business loan with a spotty credit history: If your company is less than a year old with little revenue, itll be tough to find a startup business loan whether your credit is good or bad. A few lenders offers startup business loans for bad credit, but these options can be expensive. That will also likely be the case for anystartup business loans with no credit check or guaranteed approval. Be wary of such promises. Potential alternative options include business credit cards, which typically provide borrowing amounts up to $50,000. However, approval is based on your personal credit score, and youll need a minimum credit score of 630 to qualify for most cards. If you need to improve your credit score, consider getting a secured personal credit card first. These cards require a cash security deposit when you open the account. But if you use the card responsibly, youll improve your personal credit and get back your deposit. If none of the loans included here works for you, or if youd like to compare loan options, NerdWallet has a list of small-business loans that are best for business owners. All of our recommendations are based on the lenders market scope and track record and on the needs of business owners, as well as rates and other factors, so you can make the right financing decision. To recap our selections... Some online lenders accept borrowers with bad personal credit scores (300 to 629 FICO). A lower credit score may result in a pricier loan, so building your credit first may qualify you for cheaper options. Most lenders require a minimum credit score ranging from 500 to 650 FICO, but some have no minimum requirement. Your annual revenue and time in business may also be considered on your application. Shop around and compare small-business loans to get one that fits your needs. Steve Nicastro is a former NerdWallet writer and authority on personal loans and small business.

<TITLE>New COVID-19 Relief for Small Businesses and the Self-Employed - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. A new relief bill provides more money and expands access to forgivable loans and disaster loans. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. Amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic, many small businesses continue to face extreme pressure, forced to adjust to ever-evolving shutdown rules and adopt new practices to keep customers and employees safe. Congress approved and President Trump signed a year-end $900 billion coronavirus relief package that would provide a second individual stimulus payment. It also provides additional loans and relief for small-business owners and the self-employed, including gig workers. Here is what we know about changes to relief programs for small businesses and self-employed workers. PPP has exhausted its funds, but other lenders may be able to assist you. See options with Fundera by NerdWallet. To keep businesses afloat and employees paid, the legislation includes another round of first and second forgivable loans for small-business owners. The relief bill provides $284.5 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration at an interest rate of 1%. The new PPP authorization expands funding to more industries and businesses, while also allowing some businesses to qualify for a second PPP loan. Second loans target previous borrowers with no more than 300 employees and who can show a 25% drop in annual gross receipts or in any 2020 quarter compared with the same period in 2019. Businesses must also have used or plan to use all of their first PPP loan in order to qualify for a second loan. Self-employed workers, independent contractors and sole proprietors are also eligible for first and second PPP loans. The loans don't require fees, personal guarantees or collateral that small-business loans typically involve. These loans are to be used for payroll and compensation costs, health care benefits, mortgage interest, rent, utilities, and interest incurred on other existing business debts. The relief bill expands the allowable expenses to include operations costs such as software; supplier costs; protective equipment and workplace modifications to meet health guidelines. It also wraps in property damage from public disturbances in 2020 if these costs weren't covered by insurance. The relief bill also allocates $20 billion for a second SBA program, the Economic Injury Disaster Loans, which are offered directly from the federal agency. This round of EIDL targets small businesses in low-income communities under the bill. The EIDL can be transferred into a Paycheck Protection Program loan to take advantage of loan forgiveness. The relief package, however, would eliminate the provision requiring PPP borrowers to deduct the EIDL advance from the PPP loan eligible for loan forgiveness. Eligible venue owners and promoters may also qualify for theShuttered Venue Operators Grant, which offers $15 billion insmall-business grants. Movie theater operators, talent representatives and other qualifying businesses can receive a grant of up to45% of their gross earned revenue. The maximum amount is $10 million. You can't qualify for this grant and receive a PPP loan on or after Dec. 27, 2020. Paycheck Protection Program loans are 100% forgivable provided that you use the proceeds on allowable expenses during a period of your choosing between eight and 24 weeks following origination. You won't be required to pay back the loan funds if you spend at least 60% of the loan on payroll and the remaining 40% on other covered expenses (detailed above), including mortgage interest payments, rent, utilities, software and supplier costs. This forgiveness amount won't be taxable as gross income, as forgiven debt sometimes is. The "employee retention credit" was established under the CARES Act in March 2020. It originally provided a 50% payroll tax credit on wages up to $10,000 per employee for businesses that closed to comply with government orders or suffered a decrease in gross receipts of 50% or more compared to the same period in 2019. The specifics of the tax credit who qualifies and for how much were expanded as part of the December 2020 coronavirus relief bill.Starting Jan. 1, 2021, the payroll credit increased to 70% and is now available to businesses that have a 20% drop in gross receipts compared with the same quarter in 2019. Businesses that accept a Paycheck Protection Program loan can now claim the retention credit on any qualified wages not covered by their PPP loan. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires some costs in the interest of public and economic health, but the tax credits offset these costs. Two weeks of paid leave to quarantined workers or those with COVID-19 symptoms awaiting a diagnosis, capped at 100% of their regular wages or minimum wage, whichever is higher, up to $511 per day or $5,110 over two weeks. Two weeks of paid leave to those who are unable to work because they have to care for a quarantined loved one, capped at two-thirds the employees regular wages or two-thirds minimum wage, whichever is greater, up to $200 per day and $2,000 over the two-week period. Up to 12 weeks of paid leave for employees who must care for their children whose school or child care is closed due to COVID-19. These payments are capped at two-thirds the employee's regular pay or two-thirds the minimum wage, whichever is higher, up to $200 per day or $12,000 over the 12-week period. Small businesses may be eligible for an exemption when it comes to leave relating to child care and school closures, if providing that paid leave would put the business in jeopardy. Because these requirements are expensive, employers and the self-employed are eligible for reimbursement of these payments and the costs to maintain employee health insurance coverage. The relief bill extends the reimbursement, in the form of tax credits, through the end of March 2021.  MORE:Unemployment benefits for the self-employed The relief bill extends deferment of payments for existing business loans guaranteed by the SBA for another three months, starting in February 2021. The payments would be capped at $9,000 per borrower per month. This means you wont be required to make payments, and instead, the SBA will pay your lender beginning with the next payment due. If your current loan is already on deferment, it will enter this six-month grace period after your current deferment has ended. You can delay payroll tax payments normally due through Jan. 1, 2021. Half of the delayed taxes would be due on Dec. 31, 2021, and the remaining balance by Dec. 31, 2022. Updated Disclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

You typically need a year or more of history and revenue to qualify for financing. Startups operating for less than a year can considerother financing options. The government-guaranteed SBA loan program works with banks to offer low interest rates and long-term repayment. But the process is time-consuming, and the requirements are strict. Only those with good personal credit (690 or higher, although some SBA lenders may have lower score requirements), strong business finances and the flexibility to wait for funding should apply. The SBA also administered the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to help small-business owners keep employees on the payroll. The general fund for PPP loans ran out of money on May 4, 2021. New applications from Community Financial Institutions, which service underserved communities, will still be processed. But new PPP loan applications from other lenders will not be processed. The PPP loan program officially expires on May 31, 2021. Online lenders offer term loans of up to $500,000. For a short-term loan, the repayment period typically ranges from three to 18 months, while a long-term loan repayment can extend up to 10 years or longer in some cases. Business owners can also find financing that can be used for specific items, like equipment or inventory. A business line of credit provides access to flexible cash. Similar to a credit card, lenders give you access to a specific amount of credit (say, $100,000), but you dont make payments or get charged interest until you tap into the funds. Invoice factoring turns business owners unpaid invoices into immediate cash. You sell the invoices to a factoring company, which is paid when it collects from your customers. If you prefer to maintain control over your invoices, invoice financing is an alternative to factoring. Time to funding can be relatively short with invoice factoring or financing. Business financing options other than traditional loans or lines of credit include personal loans for business or business credit cards. Apersonal loan for business is a good option if your business is still young and you dont qualify for traditional financing. Personal-loan providers look at your personal credit score and income instead of your business history. A business credit card offers revolving credit, making it a solid option for short-term expenses. It can also be easier to qualify for a business credit card than a small-business loan. While credit limits tend to be smaller than a line of credit, a business credit card may offer rewards, such as cash back or travel points. Every lender has different underwriting guidelines, but they generally consider similar factors, including personal credit score, your time in business and annual revenue. Lenders also consider your cash flow and ability to repay the debt. Banks that offer small-business loans typically require a strong personal credit score (starting in the 700s), several years in business and a solid track record of business finances such as strong cash flow. In some cases, banks will require collateral. Depending on the lender, youll be asked to share financial documents like tax returns, and bank and cash-flow statements. Read more about how to get a small-business loan. Having strong personal credit can help you qualify for lower rates and give you more financing options. If you dont need business financing right away, consider building your credit score. If you dont know your credit score or want to monitor it consistently, several personal finance websites, including NerdWallet, offer free credit score access. Track your progress and open more doors for financing your business. Only about 1 in 5 businesses that apply for a loan from a big bank are approved. We help business owners by working with online lenders that simplify the loan application process and approve more small businesses.

Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. Getting a small-business loancan be a time-consuming process. By knowing whether you'll meet a lender's qualifications ahead of time, you can avoid potential frustration. Here are five steps to help you qualify for a small-business loan. Personal credit scores indicate your ability to repay personal debts, such as credit cards, car loans and a mortgage. Small-business lenders require a personal credit score because they want to see how you manage debt. FICO scores, commonly used in lending decisions, range from 300 to 850 (the higher, the better).You can get a free credit score on NerdWallet and a free copy of your credit reports at AnnualCreditReport.com. Fast ways to improve your personal credit include disputing any inaccuracies in your report and paying bills on time and in full. More-established companies will havebusiness credit scores (which generally range from 0 or 1 to 100) with credit bureaus such as Experian, Equifax and Dun & Bradstreet. Steps to building business creditincludeestablishing trade lines and keeping public records clean. Youll likely need excellent business credit and good personal credit to qualify for a government-backedSBA loan or traditional bank small-business loan. Online lenders may be more lenient with credit scores, emphasizing your businesss cash flow and track record instead. You'll typically need to meet minimum criteria around credit scores, annual revenue and years in business to qualify for a business loan, though some lenders may be flexible if you underperform in one area but overperform in another. Qualifications can also vary by the type of business loan you want. For example: For loans backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration:Your business must meet the SBA's definition of a "small" business, operate as a for-profit company and cant be an ineligible business, likelife insurance companies and financial businesses such as banks. You must also be current on all government loans with no past defaults youll be disqualified if youve been late on a federal student loan or government-backed mortgage, for instance. For bank and online business loans.Banks and online lenders typically underwrite loans based on traditional factors, but online loans carry less stringent requirements. For example, some online lenders offer bad credit business loansor may approve companies that haven't been in business as long. On the downside, this ease of qualification typically comes with a more expensive loan. Banks and other traditional lenders typically require a wide range of paperwork when you apply for a small-business loan.The financial and legal documents you may need for a small-business loan include: Personal and business income tax returns. Balance sheet and income statement. Personal and business bank statements. A photo of your drivers license. Commercial leases. Business licenses. Articles of incorporation. A resume that shows relevant management or business experience. Financial projections if you have a limited operating history. Online lenders may provide a streamlined application process with fewer documents and faster underwriting. If you have good credit and strong business finances, some online lenders may offer you rates comparable to bank loans. When getting a business loan, be sure to compare options to find the lowest cost loan that fits your company's needs. Lenders will want to know how you plan to use the money and see that you have a strong ability to repay. They may require a solid business plan that details the purpose of the loan and how you expect it to increase profits. You business plan should also include the following: Company description. Product and/or service description. Management team. Industry analysis. Facilities and operations plan. Current and projected financials. Promotional, marketing and sales strategy. SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats). Your business plan should clearly demonstrate that you will have enough cash flow to cover ongoing business expenses and the new loan payments. This can give the lender more confidence in your business, increasing your chances at loan approval. Use NerdWalletsbusiness loan calculatorto estimate your monthly loan payments: To qualify for a small-business loan, you may have to provide collateral to back the loan. Business collateral is an asset, such as equipment, real estate or inventory, that can be seized and sold by the lender if you cant make your payments. Its a way lenders can recover their money if your business fails. For example, SBA 7(a) loans above $25,000 require collateral, plus a personal guarantee from every owner of 20% or more of the business. A personal guarantee puts your credit score and your personal assets on the hook. Some online lenders do not require collateral but may want a personal guarantee. Others may also take a blanket lien on your business assets essentially another form of collateral giving the lender the right to take business assets (real estate, inventory, equipment) to recoup an unpaid loan. Each lender has its own rules, so ask questions if you're unsure what's required. If you dont have collateral to get a loan or dont want to take on the risk of losing personal or business assets, unsecured business loans may be a better option. NerdWallet has come up with a list of the best small-business loans to meet your needs and goals. We gauged lender trustworthiness and user experience, among other factors, and arranged lenders by categories that include your revenue and how long youve been in business.

We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us.

You may need to try crowdfunding or tap friends and family to finance your new business. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. Entrepreneurs often have a hard time securing a startup business loan. A new business venture is just too risky for most traditional banks. But there are lenders willing to offer small-business loans to a fledgling startup, including alternative lenders and microlenders, as well as other funding options for scrappy entrepreneurs. Keep in mind: If youre just starting out, youll likely need to borrow money based on your personal finances. But few lenders offer startup business loans for bad-credit borrowers (a FICO score below 630). Be wary of any lender that offers startup loans with no credit check or guaranteed approval. It could be an expensive option or a scam. To build your credit score fast, check your credit reports for mistakes that could be weighing down your score and dispute them with the credit bureaus, maintain a low balance on your credit cards and stay on top of all of your bills. The U.S. Small Business Administration's microloan program offers loans of up to $50,000 for small businesses looking to start or expand. The average SBA microloan is about $13,000. SBA microloans are administered by nonprofit community lenders and are typically easier to qualify for than larger-dollar loans. The downside: Funding may not be sufficient for all borrowers. The SBAs flagship 7(a) loan program also offers financing that borrowers can useto start businesses. But SBA 7(a) loans are tough to get. They typically go to established businesses that can provide collateral a physical asset, such as real estate or equipment, that the lender can sellif you default. The qualificationsare strict, and even if you qualify, applying for a small-business loan can take several months. Microlenders and nonprofit lenderscan be a less difficult route, especially if you have shaky finances. Many focus onminority or traditionally underserved small-business owners, as well as small businesses in communities that are struggling economically. Generally, youll get solid loan terms from these lenders, making it possible for you to grow your business and establish better credit. That can help you qualifyfor other types of financing down the road. Perhaps the most common way of financing a new small business is to borrow money from friends or family. Of course, if your credit is bad and your family and friends know it youll have to persuade themthat youll be able to pay them back. In these situations, the potential cost of failure isn't just financial; it'spersonal. Business is personal, regardless of what people say, says David Nilssen, CEO of Guidant Financial, a small-business financing company. For most people, itd be difficult to separate the two. Trim your list of friends and family to those who understand your plans, and do your best to make certain they're comfortable with the risks involved.  MORE: Debt vs. equity financing: Which is right for you? Many entrepreneurs rely business credit cards for startups as funding. You can use this option as short-term financing for business purchases you know you can pay off quickly. Let the balance linger and interest charges will pile up, quickly turning your credit card into a very expensive small-business loan. The annual percentage rates on your business credit card is based largely on your personal credit scores. If you have poor personal credit, youll have a higher interest rate. Its worth noting: Research shows that small businesses that rely heavily on credit card financing typically fail. New small-business owners can also access financing through personal loans, such as those offered by online lenders. Personal business loans can be a good option for borrowers with excellent personal credit and strong income. But as with credit cards, personal loans can have high APRs (up to 36%), especially for bad-credit borrowers. Nilssen says small-business owners should consider personal loans "an option of last resort." "Where they can work," he says, "is when a business just needs a small amount of money for things like early-stage production or buying equipment." Crowdfunding has become a popular way for small businesses to raise money, thanks to such sites as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which let you solicit funds throughonline campaigns. Instead of paying back your donors, you give them gifts, which is why this system is also calledrewards-based crowdfunding. New avenues are also opening up for equity crowdfunding, in which you tap a public pool of investors who agree to finance your small business in exchange for equity ownership. This became an even broader option recently with new securities regulations that allow small-business owners to reach out to mom-and-pop investors, not just accredited investors. Crowdfunding is good for the entrepreneur who has a product and wants to test the market and validate the opportunity, Nilssen says. No credit necessary. Small-business grants from private foundations and government agencies are anotherway to raise startup funds for your small business. Theyre not always easy to get, but free capital might be worth the hard work for some new businesses. For example, if you served in the U.S.military, you can access small-business grants for veterans. There are also small-business grants for women. If you're just starting a business, you'll likely have to borrow money based on your personal finances. So having a strong personal credit score will help you qualify for financing. A good credit score starts at around 700 (credit scores range from 300 to 850). The short answer is yes. Because you're just starting a business, you don't have an established track record for banks and other lenders to evaluate. NerdWallets interactive small-business loans tool allows you to find financing that meets your individual goals. Sort by the age of your business, your credit score and the amount of money you need. Lenders were chosen based on factors including trustworthiness and user experience. Updated Disclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn Supporting small and minority, womens and veteran-owned businesses in state contracting is a priority for Gov. Jay Inslee and the state of Washington. Small businesses are the backbone of the state economy about 99 percent of state businesses are small. Washington small businesses also employ 1.3 million workers, which is about 51 percent of Washingtons total workforce. Many of these businesses are women-, minority- and veteran-owned. Ensuring these businesses have contracting opportunities gives Washington state government access to a wider array of business solutions, helps drive innovation and strengthens our economic growth. Successful small businesses led by minorities, women and veterans help make our economy and our families more resilient strengthening our communities and improving the quality of life for all Washingtonians.  Washingtons diversity is one of its greatest economic and cultural strengths, yet for fiscal year 2018 only 3.6 percent of the nearly $5 billion that the state spends with the private sector is with small businesses owned by women, minorities or veterans. We need to do better. Diversity in state contracting is good business and good for the state. Thats why Gov. Inslee formed the states Business Diversity Subcabinet. The work the Subcabinet did during its first phase was not very visible but the work was necessary to lay the foundation for meaningful change.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us.

Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Angel investors are private, wealthy investors who will finance your business in exchange for an ownership stake. Is your early-stage startup in need of some capital? One potential source of funds is angel investors: private, wealthy investors who will finance your business in exchange for an ownership stake. Heres an overview of angel investors, some of the pros and cons of this kind of small-business financing, how to determine whether its right for your startup and how to bring potential investors on board. Angel investors are entrepreneurs and accredited investors (those with either a minimum net worth of $1 million or at least $200,000 in annual income) who provide financing for small startups or early-stage businesses. Investment amounts can range anywhere from $5,000 to $1 million or higher, depending on the size of the startup and the percent of ownership sold. Angel investors may also form an angel group, in which they evaluate businesses and invest together, pooling resources to make larger investments. Each year, angel investors invest more than $20 billion in U.S. startups, according to Inc. Magazine, and roughly 225,000 people have made an angel investment in the past two years, according to the Angel Capital Association. Angel investors also may invest when a business cant get financing from a bank or a financial institution, says Craig Smalley, an accountant and financial advisor for small businesses in Orlando, Florida. Usually the type of business is something that a bank wont invest in its usually businesses that banks dont understand very well, he says. Generally speaking, angel investors are interested in high-growth, high-potential startups that can earn them several times their original investment. In other words, the potential rewards need to be substantial enough to outweigh the numerous risks of investing in a startup. After all, about half of all new businesses dont survive their first five years, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. Although angel investors may invest in any industry type, technology tends to be the most popular sector for angel investments, says Kevin Strophel, a financial advisor with Kumquat Wealth in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Technology is one of the industries that appeals to angels because the product can be immensely scalable, with an often limited requirement for additional resources, Strophel says. This drives profitability, which drives valuation and return on investment. Typically, the capital provided by angel investors is exchanged for equity ownership (stock in the company) or convertible debt, which refers to a loan that can be converted to equity at a later date. With equity, the investor would provide upfront capital for an ownership stake in the company. For example, a company that is valued at $1 million might sell 20% of its equity worth $200,000 to an angel investor or an angel group. Its important to know the value of your company, as angel investors are looking for an investment based on its valuation, Smalley says. For instance, if you want somebody to give you $100,000, and youre willing to give them 25% of the business, your business better be worth $400,000, Smalley says. A lot of angel investors will tear apart a bad valuation. Its also important to believe in yourself and what youre doing. Theres nothing worse than a business owner that doesnt believe in what theyre selling, Smalley says. Angel investors are often experts in the industry in which your business operates. Its also possible they are entrepreneurs themselves and started their own business in your field. If this is the case, they should be able to provide firsthand business advice and high-quality coaching to help your business succeed. Angel investors tend to have a lot of industry connections, so they may be able to introduce you to potential new customers, additional financing sources, business partnerships and other relevant contacts. Angel investors only make money if your business is successful. This should motivate them to help add as much value as possible to your business. If your small business is in need of financing in the future, follow-up investments from angel investors are possible. The financing is not that easy to obtain. Even if you think your company offers outstanding growth potential or a game-changing type of product, angel investors still might reject your pitch. After all, investing in a startup is risky. Some angel investors might demand a larger ownership position because of the risk involved; you may give away a larger equity position in your company than you had planned. Not all angel investors are helpful. For this reason, its important to do the proper due diligence on the angel investor to ensure their interests are aligned with yours. Ask for references and, if possible, talk with other investors who have also raised money from this investor. You want to make sure the angel investor will be a good business partner, help your company grow and contribute to its success, instead of just looking for a return on their investment. Youll likely need to prepare a lot of paperwork, such as income statements and projections, balance sheets, cash flow statements and bank statements, so be ready for a potentially lengthy, time-consuming process. Only startups and early-stage businesses that can be scaled for growth are suitable for angel investments. This means your business should be able to increase its sales very fast over the next few years without a huge increase in fixed costs and expenses, because this is what appeals the most to angel investors. If youre willing to give up equity ownership and potentially majority control of your company, and you think youd benefit from bringing an experienced investor on board, then angel investors could be a smart move. That investor can provide the upfront capital and guidance your startup needs. Its vital the investor you bring on board is credible, has proven experience in your industry and can help add value to your company. Angel investors can be friends, family or inner networks, individual angel investors, or a team of investors, also known as an angel group. Angel investors congregate at both regional and national events that are focused on sourcing new investment ideas and screening companies, Stophel says. You can find potential investors at either the Angel Capital Association, which is the official industry alliance of over 100 of the largest angel investor groups in the United States, or the Angel Resource Institute, a nonprofit that provides education and information on the best practices in the field of angel investing. FundingPost is one resource that brings entrepreneurs together with angel investors through its roundtable events.

Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. SBA loans offer the lowest rates on the market, but rates can change based on the Federal Reserve's actions. The Paycheck Protection Program officially ends May 31, 2021. Read ourPPPpage for more information or visit our PPP Loan Forgiveness Guide. For many business owners, government small-business loans are the holy grail. SBAloan interest rates are some of the most competitive among lenders. SBA loan size 7(a) loan paid off in under 7 years * 7(a) loan paid off in over 7 years * $25,000 or less 7.50% 8.0% $25,001 to $50,000 6.50% 7.0% More than $50,000 5.50% 6.0% *Rates calculated with the current prime rate of 3.25%.Updated January 2021. Keeping up on the Small Business Administrations terms and rates is part of a smart approach to finding asmall-business loan. The 7(a) loan is the SBAs most popular product and offers a flexible sum of cash for a variety of uses, including managing daily operations, purchasing new products and refinancing high-interest loans.Business borrowers also find low-cost financing for land and other major purchases with SBA 504 loans. The SBA sets interest rate guidelines for lenders, which helps keep small-business owners' borrowing costs low. Interest rates for SBA 7(a) loans are the daily prime rate, which changes based on actions taken by the Federal Reserve, plus a lender spread. The spread is negotiated between the borrower and the lender, and can result in either fixed or variable interest rates. However, the SBA caps the maximum spread lenders can chargebased on the size and maturity of the loan. A lender providing an SBA loan may also calculate interest rates using the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 3% or the SBAs optional peg rate instead of the daily prime rate. Heres a breakdown of SBA business loan terms and rates, including interest and fees. Loan size $25,000 or less $25,001 - $50,000 More than $50,000 Maximum interest rate *Prime + 4.25% *Prime + 3.25% *Prime + 2.25% Loan size $25,000 or less $25,001 - $50,000 More than $50,000 Maximum interest rate *Prime + 4.75% *Prime + 3.75% *Prime + 2.75% *The current prime rate, as of January 2021, is 3.25%. SBA Express loans are part of the 7(a) program but can have higher interest rates. Their rates range from prime plus 4.5% to prime plus 6.5%, depending on how much you borrow. Remember that interest rates make up only part of your expenses. Your APRreflects your true cost of borrowing, including yourinterest rateandall fees associated with the loan. 7(a) loans do not have a minimum loan amount and max out at $5 million. The SBA guarantees 85% of your loan if its less than $150,000 and 75% if its more than $150,000. However, it limits guarantees to $3.75 million. SBA loans arent easy to qualify for. Learn the qualifications for SBA loansto make sure theyre right for you. 7(a) loan guaranty fees are based on the loan amount and maturity date and apply only to the guaranteed portion of the loan. Lenders are required to pay the SBA the guaranty fee, but some pass the expense on to you. However, the SBA limits the maximum amount you will be charged. You'll pay no guaranty fee if your loanis less than $150,000.If it's more than $150,000 and matures in less than a year, youll see a 0.25% guaranty fee. If your loan is for more than $150,000 and takes more than a year to mature, youll be charged based ona three-tier system: 3% on loans ofbetween$150,000 and $700,000. 3.5% on loans of between $701,000 and $1 million. 3.75% on loans ofmore than $1 million. Business borrowers looking to buy land, buildings or major equipment withlong-term, fixed-rate financing can apply forSBA 504 loans. These loansare partially funded by certified development companies, nonprofit organizations focused on community economic development. The loans require collateral, typically the assets that are being financed, as well as personal guarantees from the principal borrowers. 504 loans are available in 10- or 20-year terms. Fee percentages are fixed but reset every five years based on principal, often resulting in a lower payment for the borrower. The minimum loan amount is$50,000; the maximum is$5.5 million. Small-business owners seeking a 504 loan are on the hook for a down payment of at least 10% of the cost of the project. A traditional lender, such as a bank, puts up50% of the loan, and a certified development company puts up as much as40%.The SBA guarantees 100% of the CDC portion of the loan. SBA 504 loan termsare primarily made up of the following: The Treasury bond rate: Loans with 10-year terms are priced based on the five-year Treasury bond, whileloans with 20-year terms are based on the 10-year Treasury bond. A guaranty fee that is paid to the SBA. A servicing fee that is paid to the CDC. A fee paid to the central servicing agent. When applying, you'll be quoted an effective interest rate, which is the sum of those three fees and the Treasury bond rate. However,you'll also pay a one-time fee of 2.15% to the SBA, as well as some additional fees, meaning your total cost of borrowing (or annual percentage rate) will be slightly higher than your effective rate. SBA loans give you the best interest rates, though the application process can be complicated and time-consuming. If you find yourself in need of money fast, numerous online lenders can help you get the capital you need. However, their business loan rates may be less favorable.

<TITLE>Equity Crowdfunding: How It Can Help Your Startup - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Equity crowdfunding can help finance a business with no debt. It's best for businesses with high growth potential. Pitching your business to venture capitalists may not be in the cards for first-time entrepreneurs or small shops, but crowdfunding can help you find both accredited investors and everyday consumers willing to back your company. Equity crowdfunding means investors provide small-business financingfor a stake in your company. It differs from rewards-based crowdfunding, which gives backers rewards (like products or services) in return for financial donations. Equity crowdfunding is unlike other types of small-business fundingbecause it has no debt component. Rather than making payments toward a business loan, you give shares of your company to investors. Equity crowdfunding takes place on a crowdfunding platform. You choose a platform, then create an online profile that includes your pitch and detailed business information,such as financial statements and business history, that helps investors evaluate growth potential. Ultimately, investors want to determine good odds that company shares will appreciate over time. Companies can legally raise up to $1 million in a 12-month period through equity crowdfunding. If you need a larger investment, you can raise funds in increments over several years. Equity crowdfunding is an option for businesses with strong growth potential. Its for entrepreneurs who want to take their small business to the next level by expanding markets or offering more products. Funding comes from investors via secure online platforms. Investors can be accredited (meaning they meet asset and income requirements) or everyday consumers, including family, friends and business partners bullish on your companys success. However, accredited investors tend to stick with high-growth companiessuch as tech startups, so your average mom-and-pop small business may have more luck attracting relatives or acquaintances with rewards-based crowdfunding. Crowdfunding platforms charge a percentage of funds raised for their services; some charge additional payment processing fees. You might also need to pay for services, such as accounting, to get your paperwork in order prior to submitting your pitch. Offering shares of your company is a novel alternative to taking out a traditional business loan. As with any type of funding, it has its pros and cons: No credit check or collateral required. Funding sourced from multiple investors increases the potential to raise larger sums of cash. The platform usually pools funds into a single investment, streamlining accounting and financial reporting. Offering equity eliminates the need to budget for loan repayments. A successful crowdfunding campaign drums up buzz about your business and connects you with potential customers. Giving away pieces of your business could prove problematic if investors decide to assert their influence on company operations. Your pitch must include detailed information about your operations, including audited financial statements, if more than $500,000 is being raised. After a deal closes, companies must comply with state and federal security filings. They also have a fiduciary duty to report to shareholders about the health of the company. To be considered for equity crowdfunding, apply on a crowdfunding platform. Here are a few that offer equity crowdfunding: CircleUp Crowdfunder Fundable Republic SeedInvest Wefunder Be prepared to attract investors with a persuasive presentation that includes marketing and project plans, financial projections and a captivating video that leaves no doubt your idea is unique and will pay off handsomely.

<TITLE>Linked Deposit Loan Program | Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn The Washington State Legislature found that minority and women owned businesses had been historically denied access to capital and that lack of capital is a key barrier to the development of minority and women owned businesses. In response, the Legislature passed the 1993 Minority and Women Owned Business Assistance Act, which created the Linked Deposit Program (LDP). The legislationdirects the Office of the State Treasurer, and the Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises to operate a program that links the deposit of state funds to loans made by participating financial institutions to qualified minority and women-owned businesses. The deposit of state funds is made at below market rates. The savings are then passed on by the bank to the Linked Deposit borrowers in the form of an interest rate reduction of up to two percent. Any firm currently certified by OMWBE as a Minority Business Enterprises (MBE), Women's Business Enterprise (WBE), Minority Women's Business Enterprise (MWBE), or Combined Business Enterprise (CBE) is entitled to the Linked Deposit benefit. Any business related loan carried by a certified firm, and made by a participating lender, is eligible for enrollment in the program. A firm must be certified by OMWBE before their business loan can be enrolled in the program. To learn more about certification and eligibility criteria visit the OMWBE Certification Page. Please note, the LDP is not a loan or loan guarantee, and the state cannot help a firm obtain a business loan. Firms must satisfy their bank's financing/loan criteria. The LDP allows a certified firm to receive an interest rate reduction on existing business loans made by a participating lender. For loan eligibility, contact your financial institution. The state Treasurer is authorized to use up to $175 millionof the state's short-term surplus funds to purchase certificates of deposit in an amount equivalent to the amount financial institutions loan to certified minority and women's business enterprises. The LDP "links" the state's surplus fund deposits to the commercial loans that financial institutions make to certified minority and women's business enterprises. Up to two percentof the interest that is earned on the state's certificate of deposit (CD) is used to reduce the interest rate that would otherwise be charged to a certified business for its loan or other financing.The state buys certificates of deposit equal to the amount loaned to certified firms. The state then forgoes up to two percent of the interest it would earn on the CDs, and the banks transfer the savings to the certified firms in the form of an interest rate reduction. Banks are required to provide all of the interest the state forgoes to the business owner, up to the full two percent. So if the state earns two percent or more in interest on a certificate of deposit, the business owner receives the full two percent reduction. However, if the state receives less than two percent interest, the loan may only be reduced by the amount the state earns. The state Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) offers a separate Linked Deposit Program for businesses owned by veterans and servicememberscertified by that agency. Any qualified public depositorythat is signed up through the Automated Clearing Housecan participate in the Linked Deposit Program. Bank representatives can contact the state Treasurer to registeras a Linked Deposit lender in order to offer the program to OMWBE certified firms and customers that are veteran or servicemember business owners. See the list of participating financial institutions below. For more program information, contact Caleb McInvaille at CalebM@omwbe.wa.gov or 360-664-9751.

Depending on your small businesss needs, you may want to consider the following features when choosing a business checking account: Minimum opening deposit: The amount that youre required to deposit when you open your business checking account. These amounts can vary, and not all accounts require that you meet a specific minimum. Monthly fees: The fee the bank charges to maintain your account. The best business checking accounts have low or no monthly fees. Some banks charge a monthly fee but offer ways that you can qualify to waive them. In this case, make sure you can meet those qualifications on a continual basis to avoid incurring fees later. Transaction limits: Banks often place limits on the number of transactions a business can make with its account, including electronic transactions and checks. If you exceed your allotted number of monthly transactions, you typically face a small fee for each transaction you make. Youll want to choose an account that can accommodate your average transaction volume. Cash deposit limit: This is the amount of cash youre allowed to deposit into your account for free each billing period. Again, after you reach the allotted threshold, youll face a small fee for each cash deposit you make. ATM access: Where can you use your business debit card? Are there fees associated with using your card out of the banks ATM network? Does the business checking account offer any ATM fee reimbursements? Does your ATM access include both cash withdrawals and deposits? These are all relevant questions to consider. Additional fees: What other fees does the bank charge for using your business checking account? Fees to look out for include nonsufficient funds fees, overdraft fees, wire fees, stop payment fees and returned items fees. Included tools: What tools are offered with your business checking account? Many accounts offer free online and mobile banking, including mobile check deposit and online bill pay. Some accounts also offer other options for customizing your business banking, such as invoicing, online payments, third-party integrations and more. Interest: Some business checking accounts offer interest. With interest-earning accounts, make sure you can meet any minimum balance requirements and that the earning potential isnt canceled out by fees. Conversely, if youre looking to save on a longer-term basis and dont need daily access to your funds, you might consider a business savings account as the best option for earning interest. MORE: Check out our picks for the best business savings accounts. Type of bank: Is the business checking account from a national, regional or local bank? Is it from an online bank, or maybe a credit union? There's a range of qualities typically associated with these different types of financial institutions that might make a difference to your business. An online-only bank, for example, may offer a free account that can be opened quickly and easily onlinebut does not include access to a physical branch location. A local brick-and-mortar bank, on the other hand, may offer a more personalized customer experience but require that you apply for an account in person and only work with businesses within their county. Last updated on June 2, 2021 To determine the best accounts, we took a close look at about 70 financial institutions, including the largest U.S. banks based on assets, debit card volume, Internet search traffic and other factors; the nation's largest credit unions, based on deposits as well as broad-based membership requirements; and other notable and/or emerging players in the industry. We rated them on criteria including annual percentage rates, minimum balances, fees, digital experience and more. Financial institutions surveyed include:Alaska USA Federal Credit Union,Alliant Credit Union,Ally Bank,America First Credit Union,American Express,Aspiration,Associated Bank,Axos Bank,Bank5 Connect,Bank7,Bank of America,Bank of the West,Barclays,BB&T,BBVA Compass,Boeing Employees Credit Union,BMO Harris,Capital One 360,Charles Schwab Bank,Chase,Chime,CIT,Citibank,Citizens Access,Citizens Bank,Comerica Bank,Commerce Bank,Connexus Credit Union,Consumers Credit Union,Discover Bank,E-Trade,Fidelity,Fifth Third Bank,First National Bank,First Tech Federal Credit Union,GoBank,Golden 1 Credit Union,GS Bank,HSBC Bank USA,Huntington Bank,KeyBank,MetaBank,M&T Bank,Moven,Navy Federal Credit Union,Pentagon Federal Credit Union,PNC,Popular Direct,PurePoint Financial,Radius Bank,Redneck Bank,Regions Bank,Sallie Mae Bank,Santander Bank,SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union,Security Service Federal Credit Union,Service Credit Union,Simple,State Employees' Credit Union of North Carolina,State Farm Bank,Suncoast Credit Union,SunTrust Bank,Synchrony Bank,TCF Bank,TD Bank,TIAA Bank,Union Bank,UFB Direct,USAA,U.S. Bank,Varo,Wells FargoandZions Bank. To recap our selections... Its highly recommended that you open a separate bank account for your business. With a business bank account, you'll deposit checks made out to your company in your business checking, not your personal checking account. Likewise, you'll pay business expenses out of the business account. Having separate accounts and separate record-keeping makes it easier to deduct business expenses for taxes. It also better protects you if legal action is taken against your company. Having commingled accounts may put your personal assets at risk in a lawsuit. Credit unions typically have low or no monthly fees for their business bank accounts, and theyre known for good customer service. In addition, credit unions can have high cash deposit limits, making them a good choice for restaurants and other businesses that deal mostly in cash. Keep in mind that credit unions might have just a few locations and ATMs, compared with major bank chains, which can have national reach. If you qualify for membership, however, theyre worth considering. Compare some strong options in our roundup of NerdWallets Best Credit Unions. Your personal bank can be a good first stop when shopping for a business checking account. In fact, 79% of business owners surveyed in 2019 by BAI,a research and training nonprofit for business owners, reported using the same provider for personal and business financial services relationships. However, you should compare multiple accounts to make sure youll be paying the fewest fees and getting the most benefit out of your business checking account. You may find another bank can offer a higher level of customer service, fewer transaction limits or greater ATM access. Start your search with our roundup of the best banks for small business. To open a business checking account, youll be required to provide basic information about yourself and your business. Youll also need to provide personal identification, such as a government-issued ID and Social Security number, as well as legal business documentation.

Other government entities, such as universities or cities, can also use master contracts if convenient for them. Master contracts typically do not have a limit on how much money can be spent on them, and they represent a large portion of state spending. As agencies must use Master Contracts, having small and diverse vendors on Master Contracts is important to allow businesses the opportunity to work with the State. You can find a list of tools below to help your agency assist small and diverse business to compete on Master Contracts. Agencies are directed to use their discretion and good, sound judgment when making the decision to not purchase from a master contract. What is an example of cannot justifiably satisfy the agencys needs? When an agency would like to use an OMWBE or DVA certified business that is not on the master contract list, there is an option that allows agencies to purchase outside of the master contact to achieve diverse spending. The Department of Enterprise Services does recognize there are occasions when the master contracts list cannot justifiably satisfy the agencys needs.

Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn  Agency processes often make working with the State more difficult by unintentionally creating barriers that prevent small minority-, women- and veteran-owned businesses from accessing public contracts and procurements. Some examples of barriers are complex contract language, unnecessary requirements, and overly large contracts. Small and diverse businesses are particularly impacted by these barriers.

As the youngest boy in a family of 11 kids, he recognized early on that food had the power to bring people together. In his words, its a catalyst that connects people. He wanted to be a part of that magic. I always planned to pursue a career in food, but you grow up and things happen, McGee said. My senior year of high school, a construction recruiter came to talk to me. He said that I really should consider working in sheet metal where Id never get laid off. To a 17-year-old, that sounded like everything youd want in a job. So, I became a sheet metal worker. However, McGee did get laid off quite often. When he was out of work, hed coach wrestling. But, while McGee was talking to his wrestlers about nutrition, he wasnt following his own advice. Eventually, he tipped the scale at 300 pounds. The turning point came in 2011. That same year, two of my wrestlers won state titles. These 17-year-old kids were living their dream, and that motivated me to live mine, McGee said. That same year, two of my wrestlers won state titles. These 17-year-old kids were living their dream, and that motivated me to live mine, McGee said. After hitting a low point, he started working out, eating well, and lost 50 pounds. He even became certified as a fitness instructor, and started building his clientele and decided not to go back to working in sheet metal. It was a low point, but also one that got him back into his mothers kitchen. I was still a foodie at heart, so I posted what I cooked on social media. It showed the clients I trained that you can eat healthy and still have something that looks and tastes good, McGee said. Before long, McGee started selling a few dozen spring rolls a week to friends and family. He added flavors, and news of his creations spread throughout Milwaukee. The sales kept increasing. In 2015, he went to 30 farmers markets and sold 20,000 rolls. He went on to sell 37,000 rolls in 2016, all locally, without retail distribution. McGee heard about the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest about two weeks after it began. Although it felt like a long shot, McGee had a good feeling about making it to the top 10. I was still a foodie at heart, so I posted what I cooked on social media. It showed the clients I trained that you can eat healthy and still have something that looks and tastes good. I was working an event the day FedEx was going to announce the winners. I woke up with butterflies in my stomach that morning, he said. I was actually swiping a customers credit card when I saw a call come in from Memphis. I asked the customer if it was okay to take that call, and when I heard the news I started crying. Now, remember, Im 62, 250 pounds. When customers started asking him if he was all right, he could only say one thing: This is the greatest day of my life. McGee will use the money to take his business to the next level by developing some packaging, in addition to paying for some farmers market fees and legal fees. Being an entrepreneur isnt the easiest path, and like every small business owner, hes had his moments of doubt. He keeps going, fueled by every little victory and fully focused on the future.  Learnings Running a small business is a process with lessons learned along the way. Those lessons can come in the form of corrected mistakes or good decisions that ended up being great decisions or unexpected victories.

She started working at a small custom goldsmith shop, where she learned the commercial jewelry business. When her workday ended, shed head to her own home studio to create and then to the grocery store late at night. During those late-night grocery runs, it wasnt the food that caught her attention. It was the waste. After noticing plastic bags in trashcans, she made it her small mission to go to the grocery store, take the plastic bags out of the trash, and put them in the recycling bin. Over time, she started looking at the plastic bags in a different way: like a tremendous amount of resources being wasted. So, Crabill started bringing the bags home, until her studio was so crowded with the bags that something had to give. I was so frustrated that I started cutting the bags apart until I had all of these piles of shredded plastic. Since it wasnt my impulse to destroy things, but to fix things, I started sewing all of those strips together, Crabill said. I sewed for hours and hours and hours. Eventually, she ended up making a 10-foot by 25-foot plastic quilt big enough for a baby whale. Her unique work of art made a powerful statement about the amount of plastic being thrown away. It also became Crabills personal catalyst for change. The idea: Find a way to transform ocean waste and recycled metals into beautiful statement jewelry and use her business as a platform for creating environmental awareness and change. For six months, Crabill thought about the idea and shared the concept with a few friends including a very nice farmer shed met the last time she had visited Hawaii. He mentioned that he needed a house sitter for the summer. Crabill took that as a sign. She quit her job and headed to Hawaii. When I looked at how covered the beach was in plastic, it was so overwhelming that I almost couldnt breathe. Instead of making it into something shiny and new, I decided, instead, to actually uncover the textures and celebrate the story behind the material. When I looked at how covered the beach was in plastic, it was so overwhelming that I almost couldnt breathe, she said. Instead of making it into something shiny and new, I decided, instead, to actually uncover the textures and celebrate the story behind the material. Thats when the name Nurdle in the Rough came to me. It speaks to the idea of finding potential in a dark place, a diamond in the rough. As a one-person business on a budget, Crabill took the do-it-yourself route to getting her e-commerce site up and running, building the site from the ground up. Social media has played a big part of her growth and gives Crabill a way to stay connected to her environmentally conscious community, even though shes far from the mainland. Social media was also her entryway to winning a 2017 FedEx Small Business Grant. She is going to use part of the grant money to build an addition onto her small studio to store tools and to test-outsource some of her metalwork. Im really passionate about building a brand that speaks from the heart and resonates with people. No doubt, she has come a long way since she made her passion her business. Im really passionate about building a brand that speaks from the heart and resonates with people, Crabill said. I always wanted to be part of something that is making a change and making the world a better place. So, I created my company. Thats an achievement in and of itself.

In fact, he typically worked out both morning and night to counter his two-pint-a-day habit. I was just breaking even in my calories in and calories out and knew that eating a kilo of sugar a day probably wasnt the best thing for me, Bai said. But, I couldnt say no. When he heard about a campus competition for new ideas, he recruited some friends to find a way to make healthier ice cream that still tasted great. That quest was a lot harder than he originally thought. They learned fast that combining and freezing ingredients youd use in a healthy shake wasnt going to work. Yet, Bai couldnt let the idea go. He spent the next nine months in his mothers kitchen in New Jersey, reverse-engineering regular ice cream to understand the science behind it. When we first started, we went to local high schools, trying to sell Flexfrost at wrestling matches and other athletic events. Then we started doing gyms, targeting athletes and bodybuilders, Bai explained. Although our ice cream was sold through the caf of a really high-end national gym for a few months, we discovered that it wasnt the members, but the members kids who really loved it. We also had good success at school sporting events. So, Bai refocused his market efforts to universities and schools. Someone is probably going to do it. It might as well be you. Since the beginning, one of Bais big challenges has been funding. Hes known about the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest for a while. In fact, he planned to enter two years before. I was working out of our first commercial kitchen in the middle of the night, and my dad emailed me the link to enter the contest, Bai said. I honestly planned on entering but missed the deadline. I decided when we had a more legitimate business going, with real customers, I was going to enter again and actually make the deadline. This was the year. Bai said that the grant money will have a major impact on his business. Flexfrost is building production centers in Massachusetts and Ohio and looks forward to working with FedEx on e-commerce efforts to get products into the waiting hands of consumers. You sometimes have to do this thing called minimal viable product. That means you build something thats good enough to find all the people willing to buy it. Like most small business owners, Bai has highs and lows days when he feels like quitting and days when he has had to muster up the energy to keep going. But for him, the journey is worth it. I remember reading this quote from Steve Jobs that said Everything around you in this thing called life was made up by people who were no smarter than you, and thats kept me going, Bai said. That convinced me that whatever you want to do in life, you ought to at least try it. Someone is probably going to do it. It might as well be you.  Learnings Running a small business is a process with lessons learned along the way. Those lessons can come in the form of corrected mistakes or good decisions that end up becoming unexpected victories.  Here are Flexfrosts top three: Financing: Overfund In Bais mind, giving up a little equity is worth having the cash to accelerate business growth. Whenever you think you need $50,000, you probably need $100,000. It never hurts to have extra cash because that will help you grow faster, Bai said. Even if youre a lean startup, you have to be able to fund your production, or youll miss out on opportunities. Business plan: Create a structure Every company, no matter how small, needs a plan and a structure. According to Bai, small business owners have to map out a structure and a road map to meet their goals, including where they need help and what resources are available to provide that help. Starting a business: Focus on sales first Its easy for an entrepreneur to fall in love with his or her product and to spend so much time perfecting it that actually selling it never enters the equation. Bais advice is to find that balance: You sometimes have to do this thing called minimal viable product. That means you build something thats good enough to find all the people willing to buy it, he said. Once you have customers, you upgrade and innovate.

Even as a little girl, she bypassed the toy ovens for the real thing, whipping up cakes and cookies before most kids could read a recipe. Tonkonow always had a bit of an entrepreneurial streak and an idea for a product that was like nothing else on the market. She wanted to reinvent the lowly waffle cone, transforming it into something more than a nondescript vessel for ice cream. You go to the store and you see nine flavors of popcorn, 20 flavors of yogurt, and all kinds of artisan ice cream. But, were using the same ice cream cone that weve used for the past 100 years, she said. I wanted to create a line of artisan waffle cones that you could pair with different flavors of ice cream, like you pair wine and food. She decided to buy a small home waffle cone maker and start experimenting. On Saturday mornings, Tonkonow and her mom got up at 6 a.m., loaded up a freezer with cones, headed to a street fair, and set up their booth. It didnt take long to confirm that her unique take on waffle cones had a waiting market. I wanted to create a line of artisan waffle cones that you could pair with different flavors of ice cream, like you pair wine and food. Her persistence led to local ice cream shops carrying her unique line of cones. New fans flocked to try all of the flavors. Media outlets, ranging from BuzzFeed to Spoon University to the coveted Food Network, began clamoring to do stories on Tonkonows creations. All of a sudden, The Konery became a thing. Of course, growth takes money, which is probably why Tonkonow paid attention when one of her mothers friends forwarded an email about the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest. She entered, made the top 100, and then got the call shed been hoping for. The fact that The Konery was the Alumni Choice one winner chosen by former FedEx Small Business Grant Contest winners made the win even sweeter. Knowing that we were hand-picked by our peers made winning the grant even more of an honor, Tonkonow said. Im just so grateful. Knowing that we were hand-picked by our peers made winning the grant even more of an honor, Tonkonow said. Im just so grateful. Tonkonow will use the grant money to purchase a new cone machine, which will double The Konerys capacity from 4,000 cones a day to 8,000 exactly what this small business needs at this stage of its growth trajectory. With a focused plan and a well-calculated strategy, she is ready to take The Konery to the next level. To keep the buzz going, Tonkonow is introducing a number of seasonal flavor offerings. Thats sweet success by anyones standards.  Learnings Running a small business is a process with lessons learned along the way.

The company, which donates 10% of profits to veteran organizations, has helped support 65 part-time and full-time veteran jobs through its company and manufacturing partners, shipped more than 30,000 products globally, and recycled thousands of pounds of military surplus that might otherwise have been thrown away. For sisters Emily Nez Cavness and Betsy Nez, growing up on Army posts, surrounded by soldiers, was perfectly normal because of their fathers career in the military. Cavness decided to serve her country too, enrolling in the Army ROTC program at the University of Vermont while attending Middlebury College. It was there that she experienced a real civilian-military divide and became passionate about finding a way to strengthen understanding between the civilian and military communities. She learned that many veterans had a difficult time finding meaningful employment after they left the military. Then, I thought how incredible would it be to take military surplus materialfabric that is so durable and has such a unique history and turn it into something beautiful with a purposeful mission. Our Kickstarter goal was $20,000 to fund our first production run, which we hit within the first two hours of pressing the launch button. She noticed that everyone carried some sort of bag and decided to make that her conceptual companys signature product. Veterans would be involved in every aspect of the business from design and manufacturing to fulfillment and sales, with 10% of profits going to support veteran organizations. In just one week, Emily and Betsy wrote a business plan for Sword & Plough, entered it into a competition, and won first place. They worked with the professors at Middlebury Colleges Center for Social Entrepreneurship and set up a Board of Advisors for the company. Six months later, they went to the Dell Social Innovation Lab to further develop the idea. The next step was generating enough funding for their first production run. Living on military bases all over the country, our parents always emphasized the importance of finding a sense of community, Nez said. So, they decided to focus on Kickstarter, since the idea of crowdfunding was inherently attractive to them. Kickstarter gave us a way to unveil our company to a community that was focused on bringing an idea to reality and making things possible. Our Kickstarter goal was $20,000 to fund our first production run, which we hit within the first two hours of pressing the launch button, Cavness said. We ended the 30-day campaign with over $312,000 raised and 1,500 supporters 15 times our original goal!" Shipping was never an afterthought for the sisters. Betsy went to a seminar given by FedEx on logistics, freight, and international shipping, Cavness explained. That's when we started thinking more specifically about how shipping would affect our business going forward in terms of not only reaching our customers but delivering a great experience. As small business owners who sell through e-commerce, it's really important to have a strong logistics plan in place. As small business owners who sell through e-commerce, it's really important to have a strong logistics plan in place because there are so many steps in delivering a high-quality consumer product and positive customer experience, Nez said. Logistics and shipping may be the last step for you, but its the first interaction the customer has with your company. So, its extremely important to get it right. Thats why we use FedEx. They plan to use their grant money to hire a production manager and use the print services grant to create materials to support their brand ambassador/sales affiliate program. Having someone with logistics and production experience will add a lot to our team and help us with inventory counts and quality assurance to manufacturer coordination and inventory management, Nez said. Of course, that new hire will be a veteran.  Learnings Running a small business is a process with lessons learned along the way. Those lessons can come in the form of corrected mistakes or good decisions that ended up being great decisions or unexpected victories.  Here are Sword & Ploughs top three: Crowdsourcing: Create a community before crowdsourcing One of the reasons for Sword & Ploughs over-the-top Kickstarter success was the fact that Emily and Betsy started connecting with potential customers for many months before their launch. By inviting people to be part of the Sword & Plough brand and their transition from idea to company, these founders developed customer intimacy before they were even a real company. Scaling: Build out a sustainable supply chain When Emily and Betsy were creating prototypes, they sourced their materials from a variety of places. While this worked for prototypes, it created an issue when fulfilling their avalanche of Kickstarter orders. Mentors and advisors: Ask for advice and help along the way Emily and Betsy continuously sought advice from the experts around them. They surrounded themselves with people who had been there, done that and gave them guidance along the way. This approach prevented many missteps early on because the founders didnt try to figure out everything themselves.  Find out moreabout our yearly contest and our past winners.

In many ways, the idea began as a labor of love. Vaid has been working with vernacular communities of India for a decade exhibiting and educating about contemporary visual art. However, when she got the opportunity to work with a group of tribal women artisans who crafted beautiful handmade black clay pottery, she hesitated. "This is not my area of expertise; I am not sure how to market this pottery," Vaid said. She felt that one needs a different mindset to market and sell handicrafts than artworks. After due consideration and coaxing from her husband, she decided to give it a shot and apply what she learned and reach out to the connections she had made to give this craft a new home. In the beginning, Vaid had to strike a balance. Because she bought and prepaid for inventory, that expense cut into other budgetary line items, like marketing. In the beginning, Vaid had to strike a balance. Because she bought and prepaid for inventory, that expense cut into other budgetary line items, like marketing. She started out as a semi-FedEx customer, using another carrier to ship to specific areas and using FedEx for the rest. Then came the aha moment. With the other carrier, if we shipped three boxes, two of them arrived with the tea ware broken. Although the carrier refunded our money, that wasnt the customer experience we were going for with our beautiful, artisan product, she said. The orders we sent through FedEx arrived intact. Needless to say, we now ship all U.S. orders through FedEx. Vaid found out about the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest through an email and initially was a little skeptical. When it all sunk in, I visualized the faces of our artists and thought about how they would feel when they heard the news, Vaid said. Winning the grant so validated what we are doing here. I was so moved by the recognition. I thought, this doesnt sound right. It cant be that easy, Vaid said. Then, I watched the video with Liz Powers, founder of ArtLifting and a 2016 grant winner, saying that its a no-brainer, that every business owner ought to enter. So, I decided to give it a try. The FedEx contest really helped us increase awareness and build a community. I had so many people messaging that they were voting for Terra Klay, she said. When Vaid found out she won, the first words out of her mouth were Are you sure? When it all sunk in, I visualized the faces of our artists and thought about how they would feel when they heard the news, Vaid said. Winning the grant so validated what we are doing here. I was so moved by the recognition. She will use the money to order product, as well as upgrade current packaging to make it more inviting and special to receive. Terra Klay has already made a significant impact on the lives of 20 artists and nine families by giving them a means to earn income in an area with very little opportunity.  Learnings Running a small business is a process with lessons learned along the way. Those lessons can come in the form of corrected mistakes or good decisions that ended up being great decisions or unexpected victories.  Here are Manvee Vaids top three: Leadership: Be passionate, but dont lose your business head in the process Its easy to fall emotionally in love with your product and cause and that can be detrimental, Vaid said. If you dont keep things in perspective, youll make business decisions with your heart and not your head. To avoid tunnel vision, Vaid recommends bouncing ideas and decisions off of a trusted but emotionally detached party, which, in her case, is her husband. Customer engagement: Keep your customers intimately connected with your mission For Terra Klay, the teaware is beautiful in and of itself, but the story behind it is what really engages consumers. Vaid names each of the teapots after the artist who created it, giving them a life of their own. She also encloses materials about the traditional art form with every purchase. Financial management: Spend your money wisely According to Vaid, its important for business owners to be conservative with expenditures, particularly when they are first starting out. For example, she used her own garage for inventory storage instead of spending money on a warehouse. She also worked through fair trade bloggers and social media to get the word out about Terra Klay instead of investing in advertising.  Find out moreabout our yearly contest and our past winners.

No question, Brian Boggs furniture is rare in the market, from their desirable appearance, to how theyre designed and crafted, to their permanence. Everything in Brian Boggs Chairmakers is set up to reduce waste, so that every part of the log is used. His designs embrace both 200-year-old chairmaking techniques and his own innovations that honor the natural tendencies of the tree. In addition to honoring the integrity of the tree, Brian and his team honor the environment. The company purchases premium logs from providers that promote sustainability and have personally co-founded an organization that taught woodworking skills to tribes in northern Honduras and the Amazon jungle in Peru, so that they could generate income without destroying the forests around them. Everything in Brian Boggs Chairmakers is set up to reduce waste, so that every part of the log is used. He knew he needed to be more strategic with his business but didnt really know how. After spending decades fully focused on his craft, he didnt have a business plan, database, or marketing strategy. Moving from Kentucky to Asheville, North Carolina, was the turning point. There, he met his now-wife Melanie. Not only did Brian make a love connection, he also found his future business partner the left-brained yin to his creative yang. Brian and Melanie are long-time FedEx customers because they know how important shipping is, particularly to a small business like theirs. We build everything to order in our Asheville shop, and we usually have a five-to seven-month wait. Our customers play an integral role in the design process, so when they receive the call that their piece is ready to ship, they cant wait to see it, said Melanie. For customers that dont have the opportunity to visit the shop, the FedEx rep delivering our box is their first physical experience with us; theyre an extension of our team. If a piece arrives broken or damaged, it ruins that important experience, and we have to go back and start all over to build the piece and their trust. We trust FedEx because we know that they will take care of our work and represent us at the door with each piece. We trust FedEx because we know that they will take care of our work and represent us at the door with each piece. Brian and Melanie heard about the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest a few years back when In Blue Handmade, another Asheville-based company, won the grand prize. When they got the email on the contest this year, they decided to enter themselves. Theyll use the grant money to create a video for their new website and to support marketing efforts. We are also going to have FedEx Officeenlarge some of our images for our booth we take to shows, Melanie said. So, were using our grant to boost marketing efforts.  Learnings Running a small business is a process with lessons learned along the way. Those lessons can come in the form of corrected mistakes or good decisions that ended up being great decisions or unexpected victories.  Here are Brian and Melanie Boggs top three: Business acumen: Even if youre an artist, a maker, or a creative, the rules of business still apply I used to think that an artist/craftsman enterprise was unique and different than any other business, and I no longer believe that is true, Boggs said. Although every company is unique, the same rules of business apply, artist or not. According to Boggs, you can have a craftsmans soul, but you still have to think about marketing, cash flow, and operations. The art of packing: Think of your packaging in terms of the customer experience Brian Boggs Chairmakers customers wait six or seven months for their orders to be handcrafted and shipped to their doors. The last thing the co-owners want to do is make the furniture arrival feel like a non-event. In most cases, the process of opening the shipping container is the first physical encounter a customer will have with Brian Boggs Chairmakers. Packaging is a big part of that experience. Hiring: Be confident enough to hire the right people Today, BBC has an ideal staff, including apprentices who will help keep the craft alive. However, early on, the Boggs made their share of hiring mistakes, something Melanie attributes to the co-founders own learning curve around matching what they were looking for with applicants that were available in the marketplace.

Although it sounds like the plot of the next summer blockbuster, its the real-life story of Yellow Scope an innovative company founded by two women who are every bit as engaging as the science kits they create. Kelly McCollum, MPH, built a career in academic research in Philadelphia, specializing in epidemiology and biostatistics. Marcie Colledge, Ph.D., has loved science for as long as she could remember, preferred looking at specimens under her microscope to playing with dolls as a child, and ultimately discovered her passion in neuroscience. For different family reasons, both McCollum and Colledge ended up taking work sabbaticals and moving to Portland, Oregon. It didnt take long for these two kindred spirits to connect. McCollum and Colledge volunteered to run a Family Science Night program together, where they were constantly looking for ways they could integrate a fun theme to capture the kids attention and engage them in the scientific process. The buzz around the events sparked conversation in the classroom, the lunchroom, and everywhere in between. The kids never had so much fun learning. They knew they were onto something. McCollum and Colledge had already done a substantial amount of STEM research and realized that women were dramatically underrepresented in these fields. It wasn't that girls weren't good at science; it was a confidence gap. So, they knew they wanted to focus their efforts there. Then, we hit on the idea of packaging the experience into a kit. We bought art kits for our kids all of the time. Why not a science kit? McCollum said. McCollum and Colledge had already done a substantial amount of STEM research and realized that women were dramatically underrepresented in these fields. It wasnt that girls werent good at science; it was a confidence gap. So, they knew they wanted to focus their efforts there. We did a Google search on science kits for girls and got a screen full of pink and purple sparkly make-up kits. It was all make your own lip balm, make some perfume. We were shocked, Colledge said. We thought, we can do better than this. We can make rigorous but fun and creative science kits that take girls seriously. That was our aha moment. They had their product. They had their target audience. And, they most definitely had their mission. One particularly memorable story for me was from a woman who bought a Chemistry Kit for a young girl she mentors. She walked in on the little girl doing an experiment and asked if it was fun to play chemist. The little girl looked up at her and said, 'Im not playing chemist. I am a chemist." Nearly from the beginning, Yellow Scope has been a FedEx customer. So, McCollum and Colledge have known about the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest for years. This year, they decided that they were at the right stage of their business to apply and were happy to make the top 100. Weve won a lot of smaller things, more local things. But FedEx is so global, with so much reach and credibility, that finding out that we were a bronze grant winner felt like the next level of validation for us, McCollum said. Its like, FedEx is recognizing us? It felt amazing. McCollum and Colledge will use the grant money to ramp up Yellow Scopes digital marketing strategy something theyve looked at but didnt have the budget to pursue before. Most importantly, Yellow Scope wants to continue making a difference. One particularly memorable story for me was from a woman who bought a Chemistry Kit for a young girl she mentors. She walked in on the little girl doing an experiment and asked if it was fun to play chemist, McCollum said. The little girl looked up at her and said, Im not playing chemist. I am a chemist. Thats exactly the kind of confidence we want to instill.  Learnings Running a small business is a process with lessons learned along the way. Those lessons can come in the form of corrected mistakes or good decisions that ended up being great decisions or unexpected victories.  Here are Yellow Scope founders Kelly McCollums and Marcie Colledges top three: Business acumen & management: Take time to learn how to run a business Neither had started a business before. Before they moved forward with Yellow Scope, they took a class on the foundations of business where they wrote their business plan, perfected their elevator pitch, and learned about the cost of goods sold. Taking the time to learn business skills up front reduces missteps down the road. Money management: Learn to manage cash flow and operate lean When youre building a new small business, its important to operate lean. Weve learned a lot along the way about managing cash flow effectively. Even the simple things, like getting terms when you can and being a little more thoughtful about timing how your money flows out, make a difference, McCollum said. Crowdsourcing: Do your homework and prime your community before your Kickstarter launch Kickstarter can be an exceptional way to gain funding and visibility for a new, innovative product. But, you cant just put the product out there and expect to do well. McCollum and Colledge primed their community. They emailed every contact, telling him or her about the Kickstarter launch and asking for support. They ended up 50-percent funded in 24 hours, and ultimately overfunded by 32 percent.

Joannou Cycle Co. opened its doors in 1937, just three years after founder George Joannou immigrated to the United States from Greece. His passion was cycling, and he wanted to help everyone of every age and skill level experience the pure thrill of riding a bike. He was one of the first people to import lightweight bicycles from the UK to the United States and after World War II began importing bike parts and accessories from Japan. People definitely started to take notice. Among them was Joannous daughter, Carine. Yes, she always knew she wanted to take over the family business. But, even she didnt anticipate that moment would come so soon. At 21, her dad got sick, and she took over the family business. Despite her young age, Carine showed a keen sense for business. She purchased high-end bicycle manufacturer Jamis, and just like that, G. Joannou went from being a distributor to a bicycle designer and manufacturer with a proprietary line of products. Changing our model meant so much more work. Now, we had to think about things like product development, compliance, safety testing, marketing none of which we had to do as a distributor. Changing our model meant so much more work. Now, we had to think about things like product development, compliance, safety testing, marketing none of which we had to do as a distributor, Carine said. Just the number of prototypes you have to come out with and the costs of the molds are insane. But, true to form, Carine figured it out and made it work building an even stronger company because of the change. Today, theyve evolved to Jamis Bikes and ship their mountain, street, recreational, and youth bikes to bike shops in more than 42 countries worldwide. Every one of its 140 bike models is designed in-house. Of course, getting those bicycles where they need to go on time is critical, which is why G. Joannou ships the bulk of their product through FedEx. We originally used another carrier, but Denise, our operations manager, wanted to give FedEx a try, Carine said. Because most bike orders take about four months to manufacture, G. Joannou cant afford to have shipments arrive damaged. I dont know what FedEx does to make this happen, but the boxes arrive in way better condition than they did when we used the other provider. I dont know what FedEx does to make this happen, but the boxes arrive in way better condition than they did when we used the other provider, Carine said. It was also Denise, the operations manager, who suggestedthe bicycle company enter the FedEx Small Business Grant Contest. Jamis Bikes will use the grant money to get kids off of the computer and out biking through a donation to the National Interscholastic Cycling Association (NICA). This nonprofit organization develops mountain biking programs for student athletes throughout the United States. The goal is to build strong body, strong mind, and strong character through cycling. Looking ahead, Carine will continue the companys ongoing growth strategy. She also wants to find a way to better communicate the companys value proposition. I want to try to get people to really understand that quality is important. I know that its hard to earn a dollar and keep a dollar. But, if youre going to spend a dollar, make sure its on a product that is going to last and keep you safe, one that youll enjoy for a long time, Carine said.
