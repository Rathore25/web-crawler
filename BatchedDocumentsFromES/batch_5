<TITLE>Minority group - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A minority or subordinate group is a group that does not make up most of the population of a society. For example: minor group of religion, race, language, LGBT, and persons with disabilities. A minority is not always a minority of numbers it may be any group that is not normal with respect to a leading group in terms of social status, education, employment, wealth, and political power, and can be an object of discrimination. For example, women may be considered a minority even if there are as many women as men because they have less power than men. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by United Nations protects the right of minority group in Article 27 and Council of Europe also affirms protection for them.

<TITLE>Interminority racism in the United States - Wikipedia</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Interminority racism, also known as interminority bullying or interminority hatred, is prejudice or discrimination between racial minorities. This article strictly addresses interminority racism as it exists in the United States. There has been long-running racial tension between African Americans and Latino Americans.[1][2] In several significant riots in California prisons, Latino and black inmates targeted each other specifically, over racial issues.[3][4] There have been reports of racially motivated attacks against African Americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by Hispanic Americans, and vice versa.[5][6] There have also been inter-racial tensions between African Americans and Asian Americans.[7] Current US policy advocates a multiculturalist discourse to acknowledge multiracial difference. Multiculturalist theorists like Claire Jean Kim criticizes that this contemporary policy because it still refuses to acknowledge the interminority inequalities and antagonisms generated by this new diversity.[8] Despite both African Americans and Asian Americans suffering from racial prejudice, there exists tension between each other. Often during discussions of racial tension in the United States, the focus has been on black-white relations, while failing to include the perspective of Asians in the racial discourse.[9] This has left Asian Americans stuck in limbo, as both ethnic groups avoid identifying with them. Yet among minority groups in the United States, Asian Americans are extolled as the model minority, given their statistically high reported educational scores and incomes, leaving other groups left as the others.[9] Despite a shared history of facing discrimination between African Americans and Asian Americans, there is a modern underlying tone of tension between the two groups. Due to the United States Naturalization Act of 1790, only free white person(s) were eligible to be naturalized as American citizens with the full rights that accompany them.[10] While the intention at the time was to avoid granting African slaves the same privileges as European American colonists, this left all future immigrants and ethnic minorities, including those from Asia and Africa, without full naturalization. The 19th century divided and then tied the fates of African Americans and Asian Americans together. Before the 1870 Census, Asian Americans marked themselves as white in the official census and began to first be called model minorities given a societal reputation for "hard work".[11][9] Yet legally and politically, the judicial system found Asian Americans to be considered the same as African Americans. In the California court case, People v. Hall, the court found that people of Asian descent could not testify under existing legal acts that prohibited testimony from people of African descent. According to the California Supreme Court, the court ruled[T]he words Black person...must be taken as contradistinguished from White, and necessarily excludes all races other than the Caucasian.[12] As the 19th century progressed, Acts of Congress such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Geary Act of 1892 effectively barred further immigration of Asian Americans till the 20th century.[13] The beginning of a mass movement of Asians immigrating and naturalizing into the United States came through the Immigration and Naturalization Law of 1952, which repealed previous barriers on Asian immigration.[13] While this allowed for the de jure protection of the formation of Asian immigration into the United States, this did not protect them from the de facto prejudice and segregation faced by ethnic minorities. As Asian Americans established their niches in society, they faced discrimination from white Americans who treated them like they did African Americans at the time. With members of organizations like the Ku Klux Klan intimidating, assaulting, and attacking Asian Americans (particularly Chinese Americans), the arrival of the Civil Rights Movement and its successive laws helped codify the rights and protections of ethnic minorities.[9] Despite facing similar nativist attacks on their culture and people, Asian Americans and African Americans found themselves divided and clashing within the 20th century. This tension and divide can be best explained not as an analysis of two ethnic groups, but as an analysis of the role ethnic minorities have played as a whole within American society. As more ethnic groups began entering the civil discourse in the United States, main media and social figures began painting these groups as subdivisions of the white-black divide. Western American society views Asian Americans successes as lumped together with European Americans. This is often used as a comparison to the economic struggles of African Americans often negating their struggles. Comparatively, they are seen socially as part of the same minority culture as other ethnic groups compared to white culture. The divisions are even more pronounced through what has been identified as middle man theory".[14][15] This idea has been used to describe the relationship that Asian Americans often play between European Americans and African Americans, and is centralized around the idea that one group acts as a linking partner to other groups, where these groups are typically divided by class or race. In terms of the Asian American-African American relationship, Asian Americans have played the role of middlemen between African Americans and European Americans, cultivating a niche as shopkeepers and merchants.[15] Within this relationship, Asian Americans are seen to be profiting from both ethnic groups, which can fuel the stereotype of the model minority from European Americans, as well as a distrust from and of African Americans. From this viewpoint, Asian Americans from their societal privileges can be viewed as being the same as European Americans by African Americans in terms of having a larger median income as well as receiving on average lighter punishments from the American judicial system.[9][15] Meanwhile, a significant percentage of Asian Americans share a view with European Americans that African Americans arent capable of getting ahead according to a study conducted by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.[16] This sentiment flared especially during the era of racial tension in Los Angeles surrounding the Rodney King case. Los Angeles leading up to 1992 had a large number of Korean Americans.[17] As people migrated from Korea during and after the Korean War, many moved to settle in Los Angeles, but could not work in the same traditionally white collar jobs they held back home.[15] Instead, many opened up businesses in areas where the rent was cheap in predominantly African American communities.[9] Korean American and African American community leaders soon realized that tension existed predominantly due to differences in culture as well as a language barrier. This came to a head during the era of the riots as Korean grocer Soon Ja Du shot and killed a black teenage girl in her store, and received a remarkably milder sentence compared to other sentences given by judges at the time to African Americans in the judicial system.[15] Relations worsened during the Rodney King Riots, as riots and protests hit 2,200 Korean small businesses.[18] African Americans felt cheated by the judicial system, as they had faced much more stringent punishments for charges involving an armed weapon, while Korean Americans felt targeted and attacked by the African American community for having their businesses destroyed.[15] This led to Korean Americans being divided by those who felt abandoned by the police and those who felt threatened by African Americans in their community.[9]

Molain Gilmore, left, speaks about how she was financially ruined by Michael Martin, acontractor who used two minority-owned businesses as fronts to fraudulently obtain public construction contracts worth $1 million and then failed to properly pay more than 50 employees. He was sentenced to up to 12 years in prison by Schenectady County Court Judge Matthew Sypniewski on Friday. SCHENECTADY - A former Albany contractor who exploited minority-owned businesses in an $800,000 scam was sentenced to 3 1/2 to 12 years in prison Friday - and received a tongue-lashing from the judge for minimizing his criminal behavior. Michael Martin, 47, of Latham, the former owner of now-defunct Eastern Building & Restoration, listened as one of his victims, 66-year-old Molain Gilmore of Schenectady, described how his crime devastated her financially. She said she can no longer afford a car and is living off Social Security. "This is horrible financially for me," Gilmore, the former owner of Precision Environmental Solutions, an asbestos removal business, said outside court after the sentencing. "This has upended my whole life. For 47 years, I drove. I can't. " Martin apologized to the victims, as well as the court and his family, but did not stop there. "It was never my intent to take advantage of anyone," Martin told Schenectady County Judge Matthew Sypniewski. "The person you see here today, your honor, does not represent the person who I am. Lastly, I'd be truly grateful if you could recommend a shock incarceration program." Shock incarceration allows inmates to serve six months in a military boot camp-style program instead of prison. "You should have stopped at 'I'd like to apologize,'" the disgusted judge told Martin, "because everything after that was either disingenuous or misdirected. You tell me that you didn't have intent to take advantage of anyone? That's exactly what you pleaded guilty to doing. So for me to have to remind you of that just represents to me that you really have no insight and accountability for your actions. You deserve each and every day that you're incarcerated. "And no, I'm not recommending Shock," the judge added. The program is typically reserved for young adults who commit lesser crimes. Martin and Eastern's comptroller,D. Scott Henzel, victimized Precision and another minority-owned business, Lorice Enterprises, as well as the theft of pension fund benefits from more than 50 Eastern employees, according to state Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott, whose office brought the case. "This former corporate executive exploited smaller struggling businesses and his own employees with self-indulgent criminal schemes that shamelessly shattered the livelihoods of his many victims. He corrupted a laudable program meant to bolster minority-owned businesses and instead ruined them financially while enriching himself," the inspector general said. Martin spent the proceeds of his crimes on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, snowmobiles, personal watercraft, a $170,000 RV, purchases for his girlfriend and trips to the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas. The state sets aside a percentage of public contracts for bids by women and minority-owned businesses. In 2014, Gov. Andrew Cuomo increased the goal for the percentage of state contracts for those businesses to increase from 20 percent to 30 percent by 2019. Martin and Henzel approached two companies, Lorice Enterprises and Precision Environmental Solutions, claiming to offer them an opportunity to partner with Eastern. It was supposed to help the companies successfully operate and bid construction projects. Instead, Martin and Henzel took over the day-to-day operations of the businesses, including decisions on staff, bids, banking and other financial matters. The companies were minority-owned on paper only, officials said. "I'm $300,000 in debt with taxes alone," said Gilmore, "It's unfortunate that it's come to this. ... I don't hold any animosity. I just want my money." To cover up their crimes, Martin and Henzel falsely certified on public works projects that they had paid pension payments to every employee. In 2014, Eastern went out of business, declaring itself financially unable to perform numerous contracts. Martin then moved Precision from Albany to Scotia, where Precision paid the landlord $1,800 a month in rent. Martin made a fake rental agreement between Precision and a fictitious company - Delta Land Holdings - in which Precision paid Delta more than $9,000 a month in "rent," which Martin stole, officials said. Martin ripped off $154,547 from Precision through the rent scam. He stole another $204,995 from Allegheny Casualty with bogus claims that Precision was a subcontractor of Eastern that was never paid for work. In reality, Precision had not been subcontractor on the project. Earlier this year, Martin and D. Scott Henzel, 52, of Albany were arrested on charges including identity theft, false filing, failing to pay prevailing wage and scheming to defraud. Henzel pleaded guilty last month to a failure to pay prevailing wages, a felony. He will be sentenced Jan. 8. Mike Martin sentenced for Grand Larceny and Molain Gilmore, company owner who was allegedly ripped off gives her victim impact statement in Schenectady Co Court. pic.twitter.com/ds7YbiEWtb Martin was separately charged in another indictment with grand larceny and insurance fraud.

Your firm will receive email notifications of bid opportunities that match commodity codes you select. http://www.des.wa.gov/services/ContractingPurchasing/Business/BidOpportunities/Pages/bidNotification.aspx Learn the procurement process of each potential customer, including their identification system for contract and services. What agencies (state, county, city) buy the products/services you sell? Check their website for information about procurements with that agency. In addition to WEBS and SAM, these systems that post contracting opportunities require separate registration. If your bid does not earn you the job, ask why. This is valuable information that can help the next time around. Social media offers an inexpensive way to connect to potential customers. Research the applications that would best fit your business and learn. Developing new business relationships takes time. Don't give up! Be willing to start small in order to build a record of past performance that is relevant to prime contractors. Talk with other certified firms who are successfully working on government contracts (inside and outside of your industry) and follow suit. Take it everywhere you go and hand it out to everyone you meet. Be sure to include examples of previous work and contact information.

<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn Notice of Solicitation - REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) RFP NO. 2105   Please visit the Recreation and Conservation Office (RCO) web site located at https://rco.wa.gov/about-us/employment-and-contracts/ for full solicitation details.  PROJECT TITLE: RCO Equity Review Project Consultant  PROPOSAL DUE DATE: Wednesday June 30, 3:00 pm, Local Time, Olympia WA Only e-mailed bids will be accepted. EXPECTED TIME PERIOD FOR CONTRACT: July 20, 2021 - June 30, 2022 CONTRACT VALUE: $120,000 - $175,000  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Recreation and Conservation Office (RCO) is a small state agency that plays a very important role in conservation and recreation within Washington state. RCO manages 35 different grant categories that fund working farms, salmon recovery, ball fields, trails, wildlife habitat, and much more. Having one of the larger capital budgets in state government, RCO passes through hundreds of millions of state and federal dollars to partners, who in turn use the grants to complete significant projects throughout Washington. RCOs role is to not only distribute funding but to ensure the projects are accurately implemented and remain in place into the future as defined in the grant agreement. RCO is responsible for completing many statewide plans, including ones for recreation, trails, and boating, and for reviewing comprehensive plans from grant applicants. In addition, RCO often is tasked by the Governor and Legislature with completing studies and projects.  Economic, social, and cultural barriers provide very real obstacles to outdoor engagement for many people in our state. Even with all the great work and investments made by the agency, a recent RCO study on Recreational Assets of Statewide Significance (2019) found that there remain gaps in outdoor recreation access, especially in small rural communities and racially diverse neighborhoods. In addition to gaps in access, there are inequities in park quality that correlate to racial and socioeconomic characteristics of the community served. A report from the Trust for Public Lands (The Heat is On, 2020) finds parks that serve primarily non-white populations are half the size of parks that serve majority white populations and nearly five times more crowded. Additionally, parks serving majority low-income households are, on average, four times smaller and nearly four times more crowded than parks that serve primarily high-income households. In the 2021/23 state operating budget, RCO was assigned to complete a comprehensive equity review of state recreation and conservation grant programs administer by the agency. RCO is requesting proposals from experienced consultants who possess an in-depth knowledge of race and social equity as well as how to develop policies that enhance equity. The Consultant will take feedback from a community engagement process to analyze the existing RCO grant application and evaluation process to enhance the equitable distribution of grant funds across the state for outdoor recreation and conservation. The purpose of this equity review will be to:      To download the full RFP and addenda please visit https://rco.wa.gov/about-us/employment-and-contracts/   Copyright 2021 by the Office of Minority & Women's Business Enterprises.

<TITLE>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) | Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn  People are invited to submit questions about the disparity study and the Subcabinet work. To navigate through the FAQ, please click a link below:  Small businesses are the backbone of the Washington economy. The vast majority of Washington employers are small private firms, and many are minority-, women-, and veteran-owned. Small businesses provide jobs to about 51 percent of the state's private workforce - more than 1.3 million workers.[1] Strengthening opportunities for small and diverse businesses strengthens Washington's economy, supports our communities, improves the quality of life for everyone, and increases competition and innovation while lowering costs.  A disparity study is an analysis that examines the number of specified individuals or groupsavailable to participate in certain opportunities, such as obtaining contracts to provide goods and services, client services and public works for the state, and those who are actually selected. A disparity study also helps to determine whether the environment is fair and equitable to all parties seeking to participate in those opportunities.  Washington state launched the study to find out how we have been doing when it comes to including minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses in state contracts and contracting opportunities. Its purpose is to examine whether there were disparities inthe state's contracting awards. The study also looked at the amount these businesses might be expected to receive based on the number of such businesses available to perform the work among the total pool of eligible contractors. A disparity study provides a factual foundation that OMWBE can use to work with state agenciesto help improve the procurement processes to achievefair and equitable outcomes. The study will also helpclarify what tools state agencies can employ to ensure that our contracting practices are fair and nondiscriminatory. Read the study.  Race and gender neutral measures are activities or programs that benefit and assist all small businesses equally, including certified firms. These measures include things like aspirational goals, training, outreach, and technical assistance. Race and gender conscious measures, such as the use of required contract goals, are those targeted measures and programs that focus specifically on increasing diverse business participation.  Washington State must follow a prescriptive legal path to use a race or gender conscious measure to remedy discrimination. The Attorney Generals Office 2017 Opinion No 2 outlines the actions the state must take before implementing race and gender conscious goals. The state must demonstrate that race and gender-neutral measures have not resolved the discrimination before it can use race and gender-conscious measures. Enforceable goals are only allowed under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as a last resort.  Washington State has implemented various forms of race and gender neutral efforts. These efforts include, but are not limited to: While the state has made significant efforts to implement race and gender neutral programs, this has not been a statewide approach to inclusion. The Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises is leading the Governors Subcabinet on Business Diversity and is developing the tools to implement a statewide program through a Community of Practice.  The Governor can direct a Subcabinet made up of appropriate cabinet agencies to address a specific issue. Governor Jay Inslee chose 12agencies to participate in the Business Diversity Subcabinet. Six of these agencies make up two-thirds of the total state spend and includes key partner agencies, such as the state's ethnic commissions. The Governor's Subcabinet is working towardsolutions that are long-term and sustainable. Formingthe Subcabinet creates a "community of practice" where agencies can use model policies, practices, and processes to foster, cultivate and share best practices in increasing the use of small and diverse businesses.  The Minority and Womens Business Enterprise Program was created by the Legislature to provide the maximum practicable opportunity for increased participation by minority- and women-owned businesses for participation in public works contracts and the procurement of goods and service by state agencies and educational institutions. The Office of Minority and Womens Business Enterprises is the sole agency with the authority to certify women- and minority-owned firms.  The veteran-owned business program was created by the Legislature to encourage state agencies to conduct outreach to the veteran owned business community and increase the participation of veteran owned businesses in state contracting and procurement. Find out more about the program on the state Veteran's Affairs website.  It is a network for state procurement professionals to share best practices and ideas to increase use of certified minority-, women- and veteran-owned businesses. The Community of Practice is working on tools to implement supplier diversity best practices.   OMWBE will continue to work with state agencies on contracting and procurement with businesses owned by minorities, women, and veterans. Equity in public contracting is and continues to be a high priority for Governor Inslee and the work of the governors Business Diversity Subcabinet is ongoing.

Expanding a business can require many different things, including money, employees, new locations, and new markets. Expanding a business can require many different things, including money, employees, new locations, and new markets. 1.Money Money can come in the form of loans, invested capital, tax incentives, bonds and other forms. For one-on-one assistance to discuss financing options, consider meeting with a Small Business Development Center, Womens Business Centers or SCORE advisor (free and confidential). For general financial information, see the following links: U.S. Small Business Administration SCORE Small Business Development Center Washington Department of Commerce Office of Minority and Womens Business Enterprises SBA Veterans Office Washington Department of Financial Institutions Microlenders Washington Economic Development Finance Authority Export Voucher Program Bond financing assistance for construction projects Fundera Startup Wisdom: 27 Strategies for Raising Business Capital Loans: There are a variety of business lenders. SBA loans are actually loans made through commercial banks and credit unions that are guaranteed by the federal government, in this case the U.S. Small Business Administration. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has business loan guarantee programs that are handled similarly. Business loans typically require the 5Cs: Before lending money, reputable financial institutions will want to know that certain conditions are met, frequently referred to as the 5Cs: Capital/Cash This is the owners cash investment. Typically, owners are expected to bring 25-30% of a new businesss start-up costs. With an expansion loan for an established business, owners are typically expected to show equity in the business equaling at least 25% of the loan amount, or to bring in additional cash so that the sum of the added cash and the equity will total at least 25%. Capacity/Cash Flow Evidence that the business owner has the ability to start and run the business successfully. The owners industry experience, business training and management experience, in combination with a well-developed business plan, will help establish capacity. For existing businesses, the firms financial records will be important for demonstrating profitable operations and good financial management. A cash flow projection is typically for both new and established businesses. The projections need to show the ability of the business to meet its financial obligations, including making loan payments, and to withstand unexpected events. Collateral The owner needs to pledge something of value. Typically collateral includes business property, furnishings, fixtures, equipment, and inventory, plus owner assets outside of the business (real estate, stock, etc.). Character The lender will want evidence that the owner takes responsibility seriously. This is partially demonstrated through the owners credit history. Conditions The lender will also want to see the overall environment (economy, industry trends, and market forces) supports the businesss potential for success. Business Lenders: Banks and credit unions for standard commercial loans. Banks and credit unions for SBA 7a loans (can be used for any business purpose) and U.S. Department of Agriculture guaranteed loans. SBA Microlenders (loans up to $50,000 for any business purpose). SBA 504 lenders (for real estate and major equipment purchases):Northwest Business Development Association, Evergreen Business Capital, Ameritrust CDC. Investment Capital: Many businesses grow using funds from investors. The word investor implies that the individual or group has partial ownership of the business.

When your business is up and running, there are certain things you need to do to meet regulatory and tax requirements. These activities vary based on your business activity, the business size, and whether or not you have employees.  1.Federal business income taxes Federal income tax for businesses is based on net profit (your revenue minus your expenses). With sole proprietorships, partnerships, most LLCs, and S-corporations, tax on business income is paid by the owners through their personal tax returns. This is called pass-through taxation. Owners are generally required to make quarterly estimated tax payments during the tax year using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040-ES. These payments are due April 15, June 15, September 15 and January 15. If youre a working owner of an S-corporation, you are also an employee who receives standard paychecks. You may not need to make estimated tax payments if you have enough income tax withheld from your paycheck. Standard corporations are generally required to make quarterly estimated tax payments on the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 12th months of each fiscal year. If you want your corporation to be treated as an S-corporation, complete Form 2553 Election by a Small Business Corporation within 75 days of forming your business or within 75 days of the beginning of a tax year (see Form 2553 Instructions). Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) are taxed like sole proprietorships if there is only one owner. If there is more than one owner, LLCs are taxed like partnerships.

Instead, its tax structure includes the Business & Occupation Tax, sales and use taxes, property taxes, and a variety of industry-specific taxes. The Washington Department of Revenue (DOR) administers over 60 different taxes. Most small businesses need to file an excise tax return with DOR. Your tax filing frequency, assigned after you submit your Business License Application, is based on an estimate of the amount of tax you will owe. If you are assigned a monthly or quarterly filing frequency, then you are required to file your taxes electronically using E-file, DORs online filing system, and pay electronically using one of several payment options. For assistance with E-file registration and filing, call 1-877-345-3353. If you are unable to file electronically, you can request a waiver. State taxes include: Business and Occupation (B&O) tax This is a tax on the business gross revenue. In addition to the state B&O tax, many cities and towns also impose local B&O taxes (see below). Sales tax Businesses collect sales taxes from customers on the sale of most retail products, construction activities, and some services. Use tax Use sales tax applies when businesses make purchases without paying sales tax, such as internet purchases or purchases made in Oregon. Real and Personal Property Taxes Businesses pay a property tax based on the value of real estate, buildings and other structures, furnishings, equipment and other assets. Property tax is collected by counties rather than by DOR. Industry-specific taxes There are a variety of taxes that apply to specific industries, such as hotel/motel, rental cars, cigarettes, etc. Click the heading to see if any specific taxes apply to your business. Because sales tax is destination-based, businesses that collect sales tax must charge the tax rate of the location where the product or service was delivered. DOR has a look-up tool to determine tax rates and the location code. DOR provides New Business Tax Workshops throughout the state during the year. Below are links to additional information and tools provided by DOR to assist in tax calculation and reporting: NewBusiness Tax Basics New Business Tax Workshops Schedule Common tax classifications Industry specific guides Tax incentives & specialized credits Reseller permits Look up a sales tax rate Send us your general tax questions Request a tax ruling Unclaimed property Update business information Consult your tax professional for further information. DOR cannot discuss confidential tax account information with a tax representative/preparer until you complete a Confidential Tax Information Authorization form.

DOR collects sales tax for local communities, but cities and towns collect their own local B&O. Depending on the amount of money your business makes, your local B&O tax may be due quarterly or annually. Contact the cities and towns where you do business for more information. Counties Counties are responsible for assessing and levying property tax on both real property and personal property. While the title personal property may not imply as such, it includes business furnishings, fixtures, equipment, supplies and other assets. Personal property tax Most people know that property tax applies to real property; however, some may not know that property tax also applies to personal property. Most personal property owned by individuals is exempt. For example, household goods and personal effects are not subject to property tax. However, if these items are used in a business, property tax applies. Personal property tax does not apply to business inventories, or intangible property such as copyrights and trademarks. Personal property is subject to the same levy rate as real property. The characteristic that distinguishes real and personal property is mobility.

Counties are responsible for assessing and levying property tax on both real property and personal property. While the title personal property may not imply as such, it includes business furnishings, fixtures, equipment, supplies and other assets. Most people know that property tax applies to real property; however, some may not know that property tax also applies to personal property. Most personal property owned by individuals is exempt. For example, household goods and personal effects are not subject to property tax. However, if these items are used in a business, property tax applies. Personal property tax does not apply to business inventories, or intangible property such as copyrights and trademarks. Personal property is subject to the same levy rate as real property.

If you are buying a business or even just some of the assets of a business, be aware that you may inadvertently be buying past liabilities in the form of unpaid taxes and experience ratings. Get competent legal advice before purchasing a business because these past liabilities are not necessarily part of the regular financial documents. For potential liabilities related to the Department of Revenue, you should require the owner to provide a Tax Status Letter with regard to any outstanding taxes by the business. You may also need to pay Use Tax to the Department of Revenue on the value of tangible assets included in the purchase, such as equipment, furnishings, supplies, etc. For more information, see our Tax Topics article titled Buying the assets of a business. For workers compensation, the purchaser of a business is potentially liable for premium owed, outstanding or pending audit assessments, as well as inheriting the claim responsibilities and their impact on future premium rates. Potential purchasers should request the seller for data and information listed on this Buyer Beware publication. For unemployment insurance, you may inadvertently be buying past liabilities and be held accountable for the predecessors debt. If you are buying a business or even just some of the assets of a business, be aware that you may inadvertently be buying past liabilities in the form of unpaid taxes and experience ratings. Get competent legal advice before purchasing a business because these past liabilities are not necessarily part of the regular financial documents. 3.Choose a business structure A business is a legal entity. It can own property, hold bank accounts and is required to pay taxes. There are different types of business entities, each with unique benefits and limitations. The right choice for you depends on your interests and needs. Youll need sound counsel to understand your obligations regarding your business. Get to know the business structure options and discuss them with your advisors to determine which will be optimal for you. Find legal, tax and business (SCORE, Small Business Development Centers) advisors. Good decisions are based on: The number of owners now and planned for the future. The types of owners - are they all individuals or are they entities (such as corporations, trusts, etc.)? Liability concerns. Federal tax implications - Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Registration and tax filing requirements and costs. Paperwork and entity management considerations. Sole Proprietorships are owned by a single person or a married couple. These businesses are inexpensive to form and there are no special reporting requirements. The owner is personally responsible (liable) for all business debts and for federal taxes. Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) are very popular. The business has limited legal liability like a corporation, but has fewer governance requirements. Creating an LLC requires filing with the Washington Secretary of State. For federal taxes, LLCs are typically treated like sole proprietorships if there is one owner, or like partnerships if there is more than one owner. However, by filing an entity classification election form with the IRS, LLCs can be treated like corporations for federal tax purposes. Although not required, forming an LLC should be done with the help of a qualified legal professional. Among other requirements, LLCs are required to create a governance document called an Operating Agreement. General Partnerships are like sole proprietorships with more than one owner. Partners share managerial duties, profits and losses, and each is personally responsible (liable) for all business debt. Because the actions of one partner can result in personal liability for the others, partnerships have become less popular since LLCs have been around. For federal tax purposes, the business is required to file a partnership return, with the income or loss going to each partner based on how much of the business each owns. Corporations are more complex structures than the others. As with LLCs, corporations have limited legal liability. To form a corporation, you must file with the Washington Secretary of State and you must create a governance documentwhich, in this case, would be bylaws. Corporations also have other requirements, such as issuing stock certificates, holding annual meetings and keeping minutes, electing directors, etc. Working owners of corporations are employees and must have federal payroll taxes withheld and reported the same as other employees. Corporations file federal corporate tax returns with the IRS. If qualified and applied for on a timely basis, corporations may choose pass-through taxation, where income taxes are paid by the owner(s) but not also by the corporation (S-Corporation). Although not required, forming a corporation should be done with the assistance of a qualified legal professional. Limited Partnerships (LPs) are not used very often for small businesses, although they are common for real estate ownership. LPs are composed of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. The general partners manage the entity and share fully in its profits and losses. To protect themselves from liability, general partners are often corporations or LLCs rather than individuals. Limited partners share in the profits of the business, but their losses are limited to the extent of their investment. Limited partners are usually not involved in the day-to-day operations of the entity. Get legal advice before choosing an LP structure for your business. Like LLCs and corporations, creating an LP requires filing with the Washington Secretary of State.

Will it work well in graphic design and marketing? Is anyone else using the name? If so, could there be confusion in the marketplace, or could you be infringing on their legal name, trademark, or service mark? Learn the difference between a Legal Entity Name (Article 3 RCW 23.95), trade name, a name used in the course of business, and a trademark, an exclusive right to use a name. You can do searches through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Washington Business Licensing Service, the Secretary of State, and through various Web search engines. If your business is a corporation or limited liability entity, the name must indicate the type of entity (such as Corp., Inc., LLC, etc.). Legal Entity names become record when you file a legal entity such as an LLC or Corporation. You can register a trade name when you complete your Washington Business License Application, at a cost of $5 per name. If you also want to trademark a name, you may want to consult an intellectual property attorney. If your business activities will extend beyond Washington State, file for a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. If your business activities will stay within Washington, file for a trademark with the Secretary of State.

If your business activities will stay within Washington, file for a trademark with the Secretary of State. 5.If selecting a corporation or LLC structure, get registered If the business structure youve chosen is a corporation, limited liability company, or limited partnership, you will need to create the entity or have your attorney do it for you. You may have heard that registering your business entity in a state other than Washington is the way to go. Do your homework before acting on that advice! If youre operating your business in Washington, youll need to be registered in Washington. If you do the initial registration in another state, youll need to register in Washington as a foreign corporation or LLC. You wont save anything in state registration, licensing, and tax costs for your Washington operation, but youll have the added costs of the other state. Determine who will be your registered agent, the Washington-based person who will receive your official service of process and business entity notifications. It can be you, your attorney, or an outside party. Create Articles of Incorporation (corporation) or Certificate of Formation (limited liability company), and file them with the Secretary of States office. Filing with the Secretary of State can be done at https://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/. /www.sos.wa.gov/corps/under start a business. By filing, you will receive your Washington State Unified Business Identifier, or UBI number (state business identification number). Create the governance document for your entity: Bylaws (corporate entity); Operating Agreement (limited liability entity); or Partnership Agreement (limited partnership). If the business structure youve chosen is a corporation, limited liability company, or limited partnership, you will need to create the entity or have your attorney do it for you. 6.Determine your business location Your business may have a clear location, such as a retail store, a restaurant or a practitioners office, or it may be mobile or Web-based. Regardless, to license your business you will need to identify a physical location. Consider the following when determining where to locate your business: Will the location appeal to your customers? Have you accounted for all site-related start-up and operational costs in your business plan? Is the location zoned appropriately? If it will involve a lease, what will the terms be? What special permits, if any, will be required at that location? If home-based, what restrictions will your city or town, county or homeowner association place on your business? Your business may have a clear location, such as a retail store, a restaurant or a practitioners office, or it may be mobile or Web-based. Regardless, to license your business you will need to identify a physical location. Consider the following when determining where to locate your business: 7.Get your federal tax number and consider federal tax filing options (LLCs and corporations) If your business is a sole proprietorship or one-owner LLC and you wont have employees, you can use your Social Security Number as the businesss federal identification number, although many business owners choose not to for confidentiality reasons. Otherwise, you will need to obtain a federal ID number (also called taxpayer ID number and employer ID number). The federal tax form for sole proprietorships is 1040-Schedule C, and for partnerships, Form 1065. For standard corporations, tax filing is with Form 1120. If you wish to be treated as an S-corporation (Form 1120S for pass-through taxation), you must complete Form 2553 Election by a Small Business Corporation within 75 days of forming your business (see Form 2553 Instructions). The IRS doesnt recognize LLCs as a classification for tax purposes. LLCs default to sole proprietorship taxation if one owner, and partnership taxation if more than one owner. However, LLCs can elect to be treated as standard or S-corporations for federal tax purposes through IRS Form 8832. Consult your tax professional for further information and advice.

If you plan to sell, serve, or produce alcoholic beverages, contact the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board to find out what kind of license you need to apply for. For marijuana-infused products, you will need a marijuana license. Contact the Business Licensing Service for more information on how to apply. For help opening a restaurant in Seattle, visit the Seattle restaurant site. Businesses in the construction trades must be registered as contractors, which requires bonding and insurance. Be aware that even marketing or bidding for a construction job requires that you be registered as a contractor. Some service businesses can require contractor registration if their services extend into contractor specialties. Examples: (a) Garbage haulers haul construction debris; (b) lawn maintenance services modifying flower beds, building paths, planting plants, cutting branches with something more powerful than loppers, or using power equipment to remove unwanted plants; (c) janitorial services that remove construction debris when cleaning new construction; (d) pressure washing services that clean buildings or decks.

When selecting a bank that best meets your needs, consider: Access to credit (loans, credit cards). Business products and services and their costs. Convenience (location and hours). Staff relationships. Ensure understanding of regulatory and tax requirements, including those items listed below (note: the RUN Your Business chapter can help you): U.S. Internal Revenue Service - income tax, Social Security tax, Medicare, federal unemployment tax. Washington Department of Revenue - business & occupation tax, sales tax, use tax, specialty taxes. Washington Department of Labor & Industries - contractor licensing, workers compensation, wage & hour laws.

Set up your accounting system, ideally with assistance from an accountant or skilled bookkeeper. Secure business insurance. If you want your business to be certified as a woman, minority or economically disadvantaged business, or a veteran-owned business, complete the certification paperwork. 10.Hire employees Prepare to hire employees, if needed.

Tax credits can help lessen the cost of new employees. Options for employee training assistance. On-the-job training wage subsidies. Employee training resources - Career Bridge Apprenticeship programs WorkSource Apprenticeship Work study employees If you noted on the form that you would be hiring employees, information from your Business License Application will be forwarded to the Employment Security Department to set up a state unemployment tax account, and the Department of Labor & Industries to set up a workers compensation insurance account and issue your minor work permit, if applicable. You will have quarterly filing responsibilities with both agencies, plus the IRS (see the RUN Your Business chapter of the Small Business Guide). Every new employee will need to complete the federal I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification Form within three days of hire, and the internal Revenue Service (IRS) W-4 Form. Youll also need to report each newly hired and rehired employee through the Department of Social and Health Services New Hire Reporting Program within 20 days of hire. Reporting is done through a secure web portal, Secure Access Washington (SAW). If you don't already have a SAW account, you'll have to create one prior to doing your first reporting. To report, you'll need information from the employee's W-4 Form plus the hire date and the birth date. Employment is an area that has a lot of regulation, including minimum wage, overtime pay, leave and benefits, pregnancy accommodations, employment of minors and family members, workplace safety, etc. The use of independent contractors is a frequently misunderstood area. Unless an individual is truly in business for himself or herself, is licensed, files federal and state taxes as a business, actively markets, has multiple clients/customers, and is performing work that is outside your normal business activities, chances are state and federal laws will require that the individual be treated as an employee. Employment is also an area of significant recordkeeping and tax responsibilities. Its important that you understand those regulations and costs as you plan and operate your business.

Payroll means payments to employees, where those payments are required to be reported to state and federal agencies, such as the IRS, Social Security Administration, Washington Employment Security Department, and Washington Department of Labor & Industries. Payroll means payments to employees, where those payments are required to be reported to state and federal agencies, such as the IRS, Social Security Administration, Washington Employment Security Department, and Washington Department of Labor & Industries. 2.Do I need a payroll? Most individuals you hire are considered employees by law. These include: Temporary workers Unless hired through a temporary services company that has the worker on its payroll Casual labor and many 1099 workers Friends, relatives, and others receiving anything of monetary value in exchange for their work Many independent contractors Independent contractors must meet specific requirements to be considered exempt from employment laws. There are several laws defining independent contractors, each with different requirements. You cant assume someone who meets the independent contractor definition and is exempt from one set of employment laws is therefore exempt from other laws. The burden is on you to prove someone who works for you is not an employee or a worker entitled to unemployment or workers compensation coverage. Independent contractor laws that affect payroll tax responsibilities U.S. Internal Revenue Service To determine if you have responsibilities for Social Security and Medicare taxes, income tax withholding, federal unemployment taxes, and W-2 reporting Department of Labor & Industries To determine if you have responsibilities for providing workers compensation insurance Employment Security Department To determine if you have responsibilities for state unemployment taxes Paid Family and Medical Leave To determine if you have responsibilities for participating in the program Most individuals you hire are considered employees by law. These include: 3.Can I handle payroll myself, or do I need a professional? Payroll calculations and related taxes arent necessarily difficult; however the recordkeeping, filing and payment responsibilities are significant. Learning all you need to know, keeping up on changes, and taking the time necessary to meet your requirements is time youre not spending building your business. If a business hires just one person early in a year, there will be 18 forms to complete that year, plus the legal responsibility for creating and maintaining employment and payroll records. Thats a lot to keep track of! Because of all the requirements and time involved, many businesses contract with bookkeepers, accountants or payroll services to handle the process and required reporting for them. Please do not overlook working closely with your payroll professionals because business owners are ultimately responsible for the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of payroll calculations and related taxes. 4.What payroll reporting and tax responsibilities do employers have?

In most cases, rates are per hour worked, and are based on risk classes as assigned by L&I for the nature of your business. Calculate premiums by multiplying employee hours, as reported on timesheets, by the rate for the appropriate risk class assigned by L&I. Dont include vacation time, sick leave or holiday hours in the calculation of premiums. Employers can choose to report salaried employee hours at 160 hours per month, or 480 hours per quarter.

Payroll records are essential. Many government agencies have the right to view and audit payroll records. In the absence of records, agencies have the authority to estimate taxes due, plus assess penalties for failure to keep records. Payroll records must be kept. Different agencies have different retention requirements but 6 years should be sufficient. Payroll records include: Employee information (name, hire date, job title and duties, address, social security number, job change dates, termination date) W-4 form for each employee Pay rate Basis of pay (hourly, monthly, commission, bonus, piece rate, etc.) Timesheets (include dates and hours worked; include activity if multiple workers compensation risk classes or prevailing wage scopes of work apply) Noncash compensation (such as apartments, vehicles, etc.) Overtime pay calculations Paid sick leave accrual, usage and balance. Calculate accrued sick time based on regular and overtime hours worked. Minimum required is 1 hour of sick leave per 40 hours of work (or 0.025 hours of sick leave earned per hour of work). Gross payroll calculations Tax withholdings from the employee Other payroll deductions authorized by the employee (such as medical insurance, gym memberships, charity deductions) Payroll check registers Employee pay records (pay stubs) Bank statements Tax reports and payments 6.What payroll records do I need to create to give my employees? For each paycheck, you need to provide the employee an itemized pay statement, or check stub, which includes the following information Pay period dates Basis and rate of pay (Examples of basis include hourly, salary, piecework, etc.) Gross pay Itemized taxes and other payroll deductions Net pay (gross pay minus deductions) Sick leave accrual, usage and balance (notice may be provided separate from pay stub. If you have employees working in Seattle, Tacoma please check with the city for local requirements) The information can be provided electronically if the employee can access it on the established payday. Note: If you have workers in Seattle, Tacoma or SeaTac, check with your city for minimum wage and other employment requirements. Note: If you have workers in Seattle, Tacoma or SeaTac, check with your city for minimum wage and other employment requirements. 7.What do I need to have in place before issuing pay checks? Establish a standard 7-day workweek for purposes of overtime calculations. Many employers choose Monday 12:00 a.m. to Sunday 11:59 p.m. Employers cant change their standard work week to avoid paying overtime, but they can change it for business reasons if they provide employees advance notice. Establish standard payperiods and paydays, no less often than monthly. Some examples: Weekly: payperiod Monday through Sunday --> payday the following Wednesday Every two weeks (biweekly): payperiod Monday through 2nd Sunday --> payday the following Friday Twice per month (semimonthly): 1st payperiod the 1st through the 15th of the month --> payday the 25th 2nd payperiod the 16th through the end of the month --> payday the 10th of the following month Monthly payperiod the 25th of one month to the 24th of the next month --> payday the 1st of the following month Establish a basis of pay Hourly: Paid a set amount for each hour worked Salaried: Paid a set amount each pay period Salaried as a basis of pay doesnt mean an employee doesnt earn overtime pay when their hours exceed 40 in a workweek. See calculation of overtime below If paid twice per month or monthly, overtime calculations may require you to look at the previous payperiod to determine if an employees hours exceeded 40 in a workweek. Piecework: Paid a set amount for each item produced or service provided Commission: Paid a percentage of sales or profits Hybrid: Paid on more than one basis 8.What else do I need to know about paying employees? Provide these details to your employee each payday to show how you calculated their paycheck: Gross pay Taxes withheld Other payroll deductions Paid sick leave accrual, usage and balance Read the Dept. of Labor & Industries Pay Requirementsweb page to understand employer payroll requirements. Overtime eligible employees versus overtime exempt workers: Most workers are eligible to receive overtime pay for hours they work in excess of 40 in a week, at a rate of 1 times their regular rate of pay. To determine the overtime pay amount for workers paid hourly Take the number of hours an employee worked in excess of 40. Multiply that number by the employees hourly rate Multiply the result by 1.5. To determine the overtime pay amount for workers paid two or more hourly rates, a regular salary, or a piece rate, read How to Compute Overtime, from the Dept. of Labor & Industries. Federal and state laws require you to pay overtime. Employees who are eligible for overtime cannot choose to have time off as an alternative. The addition of overtime pay will affect payroll tax calculations. See the Dept. of Labor & Industries Understanding Overtime web page for more information. Employers do not have to pay overtime to certain managers, administrators and professionals who have significant decision-making authority, outside sales representatives, some live-in care givers, certain farm workers, and a few other types of workers. Before determining that an employee is exempt from overtime, read L&Is Jobs Not Paid Overtime web page. Deductions from paychecks See L&Is Deductions from Pay web page 9.How can I estimate payroll costs? To calculate the cost of Washington states Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefit, you can use the Employment Security Departments Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefit Calculator. Use the online Payroll Calculator to estimate payroll costs (see below). There are two different calculators, one for hourly employees and the other for salaried employees. Youll need to enter the appropriate information into the white cells. The shaded cells will calculate automatically. Starting January 1, 2018, employers in Washington are required to provide their employees with paid sick leave. This calculator does not include a line-item for paying this requirement. In addition to wage or salary and hours worked, youll also need to enter the state unemployment insurance (UI) tax rate provided by the Employment Security Department and the workers compensation insurance rate provided by the Department of Labor & Industries. If you dont yet know your UI rate, you can use 2% as a reasonable approximation, or contact Employment Security if accuracy is important. If you dont yet know the workers comp rate, you can go to Rates & Risk Classes and find the rate for a similar business activity, or call L&I at 360-902-4817 if accuracy is important.

Employers have many responsibilities beyond whats required for payroll. These include development and implementation of an employee safety program, posting required posters, providing breaks and meal periods, getting a minor work permit and authorizations when hiring workers under 18, and a number of others. Attending the Department of Labor and Industries workshops is highly recommended.

Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn OPEN your business Is your out-of-state business planning to operate in Washington? Your out-of-state businesses will need to comply with Washington laws and regulations if you: Purchase a Washington business. Operate in or open a physical location in Washington. Perform on long-term or short-term contracts in Washington. Hire employees who work from their homes in Washington. Have a taxable presence (i.e. nexus) in Washington. Your out-of-state businesses will need to comply with Washington laws and regulations if you: 1.Are you buying an existing Washington business? If you are buying a business or even just some of the assets of a business, be aware that you may inadvertently be buying past liabilities in the form of unpaid taxes and experience ratings.

In addition to the state B&O tax, many cities and towns also impose local B&O taxes (see below).

DOR has a look-up tool to determine tax rates and the location code. Use tax Use sales tax applies when businesses make purchases without paying sales tax, such as internet purchases or purchases made in Oregon. Real and Personal Property Taxes Businesses pay a property tax based on the value of real estate, buildings and other structures, furnishings, equipment and other assets.

Business description Your business description provides the who, what, when, where of your business, including ownership, the type of business, start date, and the location. Your business ownership structure will be included in this section. A business is a legal entity. It can own property, hold bank accounts and is required to pay taxes. There are different types of business entities, each with unique benefits and limitations. The right choice for you depends on your interests and needs. Youll need sound counsel to understand your obligations regarding your business. Get to know the business structure options and discuss them with your advisors to determine which will be best for you. Find legal, tax and business (SCORE, Small Business Development Centers) advisors. Things to consider when making your decision include: The number of owners now and in the future. The types of owners - such as individuals or entities (corporations, trusts, etc.). Liability concerns. Federal tax implications - Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Registration and tax filing requirements and costs. Paperwork and entity management considerations. Sole Proprietorships are owned by a single person or a married couple. These businesses are inexpensive to form and there are no special reporting requirements. The owner is personally responsible (liable) for all business debts and for federal taxes. Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) are very popular. The business has limited legal liability like a corporation, but has fewer governance requirements. Creating an LLC requires filing with the Washington Secretary of State. For federal taxes, LLCs are typically treated like sole proprietorships if there is one owner, or like partnerships if there is more than one owner. However, by filing an entity classification election form with the IRS, LLCs can be treated like corporations for federal tax purposes. Although not required, forming an LLC should be done with the help of a qualified legal professional. Among other requirements, LLCs must create a governance document called an Operating Agreement. General Partnerships are like sole proprietorships with more than one owner. Partners share managerial duties, profits and losses, and each is personally responsible (liable) for all business debt. Because the actions of one partner can result in personal liability for the others, partnerships have become less popular since LLCs have been around. For federal tax purposes, the business is required to file a partnership return, with the income or loss going to each partner based on how much of the business each owns. Corporations are more complex structures than the others. As with LLCs, corporations have limited legal liability. To form a corporation, you must file with the Washington Secretary of State and you must create a governance document which, in this case, would be bylaws. Corporations also have other requirements, such as issuing stock certificates, holding annual meetings and keeping minutes, electing directors, etc. Working owners of corporations are employees and must have federal payroll taxes withheld and reported the same as other employees. Corporations file federal corporate tax returns with the IRS. If qualified and applied for on a timely basis, corporations may choose pass-through taxation (S-Corporation). Although not required, forming a corporation should be done with the assistance of a qualified legal professional. Limited Partnerships (LPs) are not used very often for small businesses, although they are common for real estate ownership. LPs are composed of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. The general partners manage the entity and share fully in its profits and losses. To protect themselves from liability, general partners are often corporations or LLCs rather than individuals. Limited partners share in the profits of the business, but their losses are limited to the extent of their investment. Limited partners are usually not involved in the day-to-day operations of the entity. Get legal advice before choosing an LP structure for your business. Like LLCs and corporations, creating an LP requires filing with the Washington Secretary of State.

Typically each partner has an equal voice, unless otherwise arranged. LLCs have an operating agreement that outlines governance and management. Corporations have bylaws that outline governance. Typically managed by directors who are elected by shareholders. Federal Taxation Sole proprietor reports all business revenues & expenses and pays taxes through personal return. Each partner reports their share of business revenues & expenses and pays taxes through personal return. If one LLC member, typically pay taxes as individual. If more than one member, typically pay taxes as partnership. Can elect with IRS to pay taxes as a corporation (either c- or s-). If standard corporation (c-corp), taxed as a business. If dividends are distributed to shareholders, dividends are taxed at the individual level. Can elect with IRS to be taxed as an s-corp.

Personnel plan Most new businesses start small and grow. When you do hire, having employees with the right attributes and skills for your business will be very important to your success. There are resources to help you with employment planning, including Labor Market Information. Employment is an area that has a lot of regulation, including minimum wage, overtime pay, leave and benefits, pregnancy accommodations, employment of minors and family members, workplace safety, etc. The use of independent contractors is a frequently misunderstood area. Generally, state and federal law would require that an individual be treated as an employee unless the individual: Is truly in business for himself or herself. Is licensed and actively markets his or her services. Has multiple clients/customers. Is performing work that is outside the businesss normal activities. Being an employer also requires you to keep detailed records and fulfill your tax reporting obligations. It is important that you understand the regulations and costs as you plan your business. The links below can help you understand your responsibilities. Labor Law Wage and hour laws (such as minimum wage, overtime, breaks, etc.) Workplace poster requirements Employment of minors Non-Discrimination Laws Independent contractors (Labor & Industries) Independent contractors (Employment Security) Independent contractors (IRS) Workplace safety (including required written accident prevention program) Federal payroll taxes Child Support Withholding Laws Worker Benefits State unemployment taxes Workers compensation insurance Washington Health Benefit Exchange Washington Health Plan Finder Paid Sick Leave Paid Family and Medical Leave Other Types of Leave Retirement Marketplace Note: If you have workers in Seattle, Tacoma or SeaTac, check with your city for minimum wage and other employment requirements.

Include in your Personnel Plan: 7.Financing plan Projections: You need to have a well-researched estimate of the start-up and operating costs of your business. You also need to have a realistic expectation of the amount of money your business will bring in. These projections will help you prepare financially for starting your business, whether you finance the business yourself or seek outside loans or investors. Include projections of: Start-up costs. Determine how much start-up money youll need for facilities, equipment, furnishings, fixtures, supplies, signage, licenses and permits, advisors, etc. Include all costs necessary to execute your business plan. Monthly cash flow projection. A cash flow projection is effectively your budget. You should budget at least 24 months at a high level of detail, showing the amounts and timing of cash flowing into and out of the business. Together, start-up costs and cash flow projection will show the total funds needed for the business to reach the point of sustainability (when it can pay for itself). Projected profit & loss statements (P&Ls) for at least two years. P&Ls, also called income statements, show a picture of the business using the equation: Revenues - Expenses = Profit (or Loss) Projected balance sheets for the start of the business, the end of year one and the end of year two. Balance sheets show a picture of the business using the equation: Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth (or Equity) Financing: Once you know how much money your business will require to reach the point where it can begin supporting itself, you can determine how to get the needed funds. Potential sources of funding include owner savings, friends, family and other private lenders, business partners, credit cards, business loans, public stock offerings, etc. Not all of these sources may be appropriate for you and your business. Although you may have heard rumors that there are grants to start businesses, it is generally not true. Only in very specific situations are grants provided for starting a business; an example would be scientific research and development that is needed by federal agencies. The Department of Commerce has a free guide outlining 27 strategies for raising business capital called Startup Wisdom. Business loans typically require the 5Cs: Capital/Cash the owners cash investment. Owners usually must bring 25-30% of the funds needed to start a new business. Capacity/Cash Flow evidence that the business owner has the ability to start and run the business successfully. The owners industry experience, business training and management experience, in combination with a well-developed business plan, will help establish capacity. The cash flow projection is critical here, and it needs to show the ability of the business to meet its financial obligations, including making loan payments. Collateral something of value to pledge. Typically collateral includes business property, furnishings, fixtures, equipment, and inventory, plus owner assets outside of the business (real estate, stock, etc.). Character confidence that the owner takes responsibilities seriously, as demonstrated, in part, through the owners credit history. Conditions confidence that the overall environment (economy, industry trends, and market forces) supports the businesss potential for success. The act of seeking investors and private lenders is highly regulated and requires an understanding of securities laws. If you cant finance your business at the level you first planned, think of ways you might scale back your plans, such as start smaller, buy fewer supplies/equipment, lease equipment or buy used equipment, hire fewer employees, find a less expensive location, etc. Be aware that changes you make on the expense side will likely also affect your revenue projections.

Closing your business, also known as liquidation or dissolution, is the process in accounting by which a business is brought to an end for different reasons and by different processes. The assets and property of the company are sold or transferred. People close their businesses for many reasons. Sometimes its because the business hasnt gone in a direction they had hoped and theyre not happy with the result. Sometimes its because the owner is ready for something new, sometimes its due to time or money considerations, and sometimes its due to death. Regardless of the reasons, choosing to close a business is a significant decision. However, going out of business does not always require closing the business or liquidation. A business exit is an entrepreneur's plan to sell his or her ownership interest in a company. An exit gives a business owner a way to reduce or liquidate his stake in a business and, if the business is successful, make a substantial profit. If the business is not successful, an exit plan enables the entrepreneur to limit losses. An exit may also be used by an investor such as a venture capitalist in order to plan for a cash out of an investment. Sell: Selling requires careful planningeverything from cleaning up sloppy books and tax records to dressing up a tired storefront and updating old operating systemseven ramping up marketing to juice sales and command a higher asking price. IPO (Initial Public Offering): Initial public offering is a type of public offering in which shares of a company are sold to institutional investors and usually also retail investors; an IPO is underwritten by one or more investment banks, who also arrange for the shares to be listed on one or more stock exchanges. Merge: A merger is the combination of one or more business entities into a single business entity. The joining of two or more companies is often to achieves greater efficiencies of scale and productivity. Close: Liquidation or dissolution is the process in accounting by which a business is brought to an end for different reasons and by different processes. The assets and property of the company are redistributed. The U.S. Small Business Administration has an online resource to assist you in understanding the considerations and closure process: Getting Out.

<TITLE>Contracting Barriers and Factors Affecting Minority Business Enterprises A Review of Existing Disparity Studies | Minority Business Development Agency</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Foreword Winning contracts that buy your products, services, proprietary work processes, or intellectual property is what every entrepreneur strives to accomplish when they go into business. Contracts are the business barometer that measure the health of your business and determine whether you grow, stagnate, or fail. For America to build a healthy and inclusive economy, minority business enterprises (MBEs), must have full and fair access to the range of local, state and federal contracting opportunities. Disparity studies conducted over the past 10 years at the state and local levels tell a much different story. This study, Barriers and Factors Affecting Minority Business Enterprises: A Review of Existing Disparity Studies, was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Minority Business Development Agency to expose the patterns and trends uncovered in these disparity studies and to quantify the impact of discrimination in Americas procurement systems. In doing so, it reveals that MBEs typically obtain a lower number and dollar value of contracts in proportion to the number of MBEs available. The report also reveals that the industry groups experiencing the highest ratios of disparity include construction, professional services, architecture, engineering services, and goods and supplies. Beyond the civil injustices that have been protested across the country and the disenfranchisement of minority communities, there are distinct underlying issues that primarily center on economic disparity. Unemployment, low workforce readiness, lack of transportation infrastructure, a shortage of affordable housing, and social issues have negatively impacted minority communities nationwide. While MBEs are contributing to the economic vitality of these communities by addressing social issues in new ways, they must have the opportunity to develop capacity and entry points into the industries of tomorrow. Local governments must change their economic development models that enable MBEs to grow and create jobs, serve as positive role models to disadvantaged youth, and expose residents to innovation and emerging industries to generate wealth creation. These business owners seek new opportunities that will allow them to engage with the entire community in order to make a broader impact. Civic participation is critical to MBEs as their dedication goes beyond economic success. If we are to improve the governments ability to advance community conditions capable of deterring civil injustices and targeting of our law enforcement officers, then our federal response must be guided by interagency collaboration, law enforcement understanding, public investment, and a sense of urgency. The findings of this report raise questions about the current and future state of economic development in the U.S., in particular as the population moves inexorably to majority-minority status. It also points out implications for the Nations economic health should MBEs not have the opportunity to fully participate in government contracting. During the past 45 years, MBDA has provided MBEs with resources to support and advance their success in growing the U.S. economy. Today, many MBEs have proven to be major catalysts for economic growth, job creation, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Due to our unique position, MBDA has distinct insight regarding current civil unrest issues that plague these communities, which historically have benefited from the Agencys funding and resources. This long-term engagement has helped MBDA to identify promising business opportunities that create jobs and generate wealth. Since 2009, MBDA has helped minority-owned firms access more than $34.8 billion in contracts and capital, which resulted in more than 153,000 jobs created and retained.* We know that there is more to do. This report is presented for full consideration by corporate CEOs and boards of directors, governors, state/local legislators, mayors, tribal leaders, law enforcement/criminal justice and economic development leaders, procurement officers, transportation and infrastructure officials, business owners, and pension fund managers and investors, in the spirit of generating positive momentum toward the goal of shrinking, and ultimately eliminating, disparities in contracting nationwide. We encourage you to read the full report which covers the legal framework of disparity studies and offers a primer for those embarking upon disparity studies at the state and local levels. It also offers an in depth quantitative analysis of disparity ratios and a qualitative review of anecdotal evidence. Our hope is that this report will give policy makers and MBE advocates the information and data they need to make systemic changes.  *U.S. Department of Commerce, Minority Business Development Agency performance and CRM systems, Retrieved December 12, 2016.

<TITLE>Latino Business Ownership: Contributions and Barriers for U.S.-Born and Immigrant Latino Entrepreneurs – SBA's Office of Advocacy</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Advocacy - SBA's Office of Advocacy Robert W. Fairlie, Ph.D., January 2018 Large differences in business ownership rates and income exist between minority groups and non-minorities. Those differences have persisted over time and may be an inhibitor of economic growth. This study evaluates business ownership among native-born and immigrant Latino men and women and compares them to non-minorities. It uses statistical techniques to understand how much of these disparities can be attributed to differing population characteristics, like age, wealth and educational attainment. Overall Findings The data clearly show the large impact Latino business owners have on the economy. Roughly 541,000 business owners are U.S.-born Latinos, with an additional 1.2 million immigrant Latino business owners. Combined, the study shows Latino business owners earning $61.3 billion in business income. However, the report also shows the large disparities in both Latino self-employment rates and business income as compared to non-minorities. For example, 3.5 percent of U.S.-born Latinos are self-employed compared to 6.8 percent of non-Latino whites. In business income, both immigrant Latinos and U.S.-born Latinos earn less than non-Latino whites, $31,000, $47,400 and $66,600 respectively. The report analyzes population characteristics like wealth, education, and age to see if these factors explain some of the business ownership and income differences experienced by Latinos. Due to the differences between the genders and migration status in business ownership and income, all of these groups are compared separately with their non-minority counterpart. For example, U.S.-born male Latinos are compared to non-Latino white males. Therefore the analysis compares four groups of Latino business owners to non-Latino white owners: U.S.-born males, U.S.-born females, immigrant males and immigrant females.

<TITLE>Linked Deposit Loan Program | Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn The Washington State Legislature found that minority and women owned businesses had been historically denied access to capital and that lack of capital is a key barrier to the development of minority and women owned businesses. In response, the Legislature passed the 1993 Minority and Women Owned Business Assistance Act, which created the Linked Deposit Program (LDP). The legislationdirects the Office of the State Treasurer, and the Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises to operate a program that links the deposit of state funds to loans made by participating financial institutions to qualified minority and women-owned businesses. The deposit of state funds is made at below market rates. The savings are then passed on by the bank to the Linked Deposit borrowers in the form of an interest rate reduction of up to two percent. Any firm currently certified by OMWBE as a Minority Business Enterprises (MBE), Women's Business Enterprise (WBE), Minority Women's Business Enterprise (MWBE), or Combined Business Enterprise (CBE) is entitled to the Linked Deposit benefit. Any business related loan carried by a certified firm, and made by a participating lender, is eligible for enrollment in the program. A firm must be certified by OMWBE before their business loan can be enrolled in the program. To learn more about certification and eligibility criteria visit the OMWBE Certification Page. Please note, the LDP is not a loan or loan guarantee, and the state cannot help a firm obtain a business loan. Firms must satisfy their bank's financing/loan criteria. The LDP allows a certified firm to receive an interest rate reduction on existing business loans made by a participating lender. For loan eligibility, contact your financial institution. The state Treasurer is authorized to use up to $175 millionof the state's short-term surplus funds to purchase certificates of deposit in an amount equivalent to the amount financial institutions loan to certified minority and women's business enterprises. The LDP "links" the state's surplus fund deposits to the commercial loans that financial institutions make to certified minority and women's business enterprises. Up to two percentof the interest that is earned on the state's certificate of deposit (CD) is used to reduce the interest rate that would otherwise be charged to a certified business for its loan or other financing.The state buys certificates of deposit equal to the amount loaned to certified firms. The state then forgoes up to two percent of the interest it would earn on the CDs, and the banks transfer the savings to the certified firms in the form of an interest rate reduction. Banks are required to provide all of the interest the state forgoes to the business owner, up to the full two percent. So if the state earns two percent or more in interest on a certificate of deposit, the business owner receives the full two percent reduction. However, if the state receives less than two percent interest, the loan may only be reduced by the amount the state earns. The state Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) offers a separate Linked Deposit Program for businesses owned by veterans and servicememberscertified by that agency. Any qualified public depositorythat is signed up through the Automated Clearing Housecan participate in the Linked Deposit Program. Bank representatives can contact the state Treasurer to registeras a Linked Deposit lender in order to offer the program to OMWBE certified firms and customers that are veteran or servicemember business owners. See the list of participating financial institutions below. For more program information, contact Caleb McInvaille at CalebM@omwbe.wa.gov or 360-664-9751.

Our pick for: Businesses with strong financials Unlike most cards designed for entrepreneurs, the Brex Card doesn't require the cardholder to personally guarantee the debt on the card. Instead, Brex determines creditworthiness by evaluating a company's cash balance, spending patterns and investors. It's a good option when a business owner has a thin credit file but is well-capitalized. The card earns rewards, too. Read our review. Our pick for: Earning rewards Secured business credit cards arent necessarily known for their perks. But the BBVA Secured Visa Business Credit Card offers a competitive 1.5 points for every dollar on qualified purchases and no annual fee for the first year ($40 thereafter). BBVA is a regional bank, and its secured credit card is only available in seven states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Texas. Read our review. Our pick for: Cash back rewards If youre interested in cash rewards, the Wells Fargo Business Secured Credit Card offers 1.5% back for every $1 spent with no maximum. You can also opt for points-based rewards, with each dollar worth a point. Youll earn a bonus 1,000 points by spending more than $1,000 in a monthly billing period. Wells Fargo does not charge an annual fee for this card. The information related to the Wells Fargo Business Secured Credit Card has been collected by NerdWallet and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer or provider of this product or service. Our pick for: High credit limit If you can afford to put a lot of money down, the First National Bank Business Edition Secured Visa Card may be a good choice for bad-credit borrowers. Your security deposit will earn interest, and First National Bank lets you choose your own credit limit between $2,000 and $100,000 (in multiples of $50) when you apply. This card charges a $39 annual fee. Read our review. Our pick for: 0% APR introductory offer The Suncrest Bank Business Card is an unsecured business credit card that may be available with bad credit. The card has no annual fee and 0% intro APR for the first 20 billing cycles, and then the ongoing APR of 11.99% - 20.99% Variable. This no-interest introductory period is among the longest for any business credit card, making it a strong choice for large purchases youd like to repay over time. Read our review. Our pick for: Average credit The rewards rate on the Capital One Spark Classic for Business isn't going to wow anyone, there's no sign-up bonus and the APR is high. What makes this card valuable is that it's available to business operators with fair or "average" credit, who don't have a lot of options in business credit cards especially with no annual fee. Read our review. Know your credit score. Most card issuers will check your personal credit score when you apply for a business credit card. Your options may be limited if you have a FICO score below 630, which may be considered bad credit. If you can wait to apply, you may want to take some quick steps to build credit first like paying off existing debt or disputing errors on your credit report.  MORE: Get your free credit score from NerdWallet Find the right card for your business. Poor or thin credit may be the biggest factor in the card you choose, but youll still want to consider a cards terms and individual features to determine the best fit for your company. For example, the Brex corporate card offers industry-specific rewards. If you run a life sciences company, it provides 8x points for conference tickets and 5x for travel. Make your deposit, if necessary. No-deposit business credit cards for bad credit are uncommon. Most likely, youll have to opt for a secured credit card that requires a deposit. For example, the BBVA Secured Visa Card requires you to put at least $500 in a savings account with the bank before applying for a card. It then limits your spending to 90% of your deposited amount. Use your business credit card wisely. Getting a business credit card likely wont help bad personal credit: Most business card providers only report negative behavior to consumer credit bureaus. But good habits like making on-time payments and paying in full can build your business credit. Plus, some issuers, like Wells Fargo, will monitor your secured card usage and let you upgrade to an unsecured account. Secured credit cards are tied to a cash deposit, which makes providers more willing to work with business owners with poor personal credit or no credit history. The card issuer can simply take that deposit if you fail to pay what you owe. But if you need more money than a secured cards credit limit, bad-credit business loans may be an option. For example, Fundbox offers a business line of credit worth up to $150,000 to business owners with a credit score of at least 600 and six months in business. If youre a startup with bad credit, an option like invoice financing could make sense depending on your business model. BlueVines invoice financing product, for instance, offers funding of up to $5 million and is available to businesses with minimum credit scores of 530 and a minimum of three months in business. You may also want to consider a personal loan for bad credit or personal credit card for bad credit. While NerdWallet recommends separating your personal and business finances, these products can offer short-term financing and the opportunity to strengthen your credit for future business borrowing needs. Last updated on May 4, 2021 NerdWallet's credit cards team selects the best cards in each category based on overall consumer value. Factors in our evaluation include fees, promotional and ongoing APRs, and sign-up bonuses; for rewards cards, we consider earning and redemption rates, redemption options and redemption difficulty. A single card is eligible to be chosen in multiple categories.

<TITLE>Are There Instant-Approval Business Credit Cards? - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Some business credit cards offer nearly instant approval, but youll need excellent credit to qualify. No business credit cards offer instant approval, strictly speaking. But some cards advertise fast decision times of less than 60 seconds and may provide your credit card number before your physical card so you can start spending immediately. Business owners with good to excellent credit (a FICO score of at least 690) stand the best chance of getting approved almost instantly. If your credit isnt that strong, you may need to wait a week or more to get a small-business credit card. Here are business credit cards that may offer fast approval and what you need to know about getting a card quickly if you have excellent credit, bad credit or anything in between. Some business credit cards claim to offer nearly instant approval. But the speed of their decision depends largely on factors like your personal credit and your businesss revenue. By choosing a business credit card youre well-qualified for, youre more likely to enjoy a faster turnaround. Here are some to consider: Our pick for: Instant credit card numbers If you need to make an immediate purchase, American Express offers instant card numbers for all its small-business cards (except the Lowe's Business Rewards Card from American Express), according to a company spokesperson. American Express Go users can also set up virtual cards to use online right away or add to a mobile wallet. The no-annual-fee American Express Blue Business Cash Card may be a good fit for fast spending thanks to its long introductory APR offer and solid cash-back rate. Our pick for: Applicants with fair credit The rewards rate on the Capital One Spark Classic for Business isn't going to wow anyone, there's no sign-up bonus and the APR is high. What makes this card valuable is that it's available to business operators with fair or "average" credit, increasing your chances of being approved fast. Capital One advertises approval speeds of as little as 60 seconds. Most customers can also receive Instant card numbers for Spark credit cards, besides the Capital One Spark Cash for Business card, according to a company spokesperson. Our pick for: Businesses with strong revenue The Brex Card has a distinct profile: It's a good option when a business owner has a thin credit file but is well-capitalized. If that sounds like your business, you may get a fast approval. Brex determines creditworthiness by evaluating a company's cash balance, spending patterns and investors.The Brex Card also doesn't require a personal guarantee and earns rewards. Our pick for: Fast pre-qualification If you have bad credit, it can take as little as 30 seconds to see if you'll pre-qualify for the First National Bank Business Edition Secured Visa Card. In addition, First National Bank lets you choose your own credit limit between $2,000 and $100,000 (in multiples of $50) when you apply. This card charges a $39 annual fee. To get a fast approval on a business credit card application, good to excellent credit is a must. If youve been in business for a while and can demonstrate your annual business revenue, these factors will also likely help (as they do with all business credit cards). Some card issuers may let you pre-qualify, which is typically a quick process that tells you if youre likely to be approved. Youll still need to go through the formal application process, but if youre in a hurry, pre-qualifying can ensure you dont waste time applying for a card you cant get. If you cant pre-qualify, the best way to get approved for any business credit card is to choose an option youre likely to be eligible for. Start by checking your credit score, so youll know if its high enough to qualify for most cards or if youll need to look for business credit cards for bad credit.  MORE: Get a free credit score from NerdWallet Theres no hard-and-fast rule about how quickly business credit card applications can be processed. Credit card companies need to take time to review your business financials as well as your personal credit history. For example, you could be approved for a Capital One business credit card almost instantly in as little as 60 seconds. However, if additional information is required, you might have to wait more than two weeks for a decision. If you need fast access to working capital, you may be able to receive your credit card number before the card arrives in your mailbox. MostAmerican Express business credit cards offer this feature, for instance. This makes it easy to use your business credit card right away. If you have bad credit, it will be tough to get approved for most business credit cards. Your best bet will likely be a secured business credit card. With a secured business credit card, you provide a refundable deposit at the opening of the account. This helps reduce the lending risk for the credit card company and helps you start to build business credit. However, credit limits on secured cards are tied to your deposit. That means these cards may not necessarily be the best fit if youre looking for an instant-approval business credit card because you need to access additional capital quickly. In that instance, a bad credit business loan may make more sense. You may be able to qualify for a business line of credit, which functions similarly to a credit card, with subpar personal credit. Or if you have outstanding invoices from clients, invoice factoring could turn them into quick cash.

Before applying, confirm details on the issuers website. Our pick for: Intro APR offer The American Express Blue Business Cash Card boasts one of the better introductory APR offers among business credit cards.

Our pick for: Flexible financing Businesses with high working capital needs but sometimes inconsistent cash flow might find The Plum Card from American Expressa perfect fit.

There's a substantial annual fee, but if you're using the card for, say, big inventory purchases, the benefits could far outweigh the costs. Read our review. Our pick for: Fair credit The rewards rate on the Capital One Spark Classic for Business isn't going to wow anyone, there's no sign-up bonus and the APR is high. What makes this card valuable is that it's available to business operators with fair or "average" credit, who don't have a lot of options in business credit cards especially with no annual fee. Read our review. Our pick for: Building business credit Secured business credit cards arent necessarily known for their perks. But the BBVA Secured Visa Business Credit Card offers a competitive 1.5 points for every dollar on qualified purchases and no annual fee for the first year ($40 thereafter). BBVA is a regional bank, and its secured credit card is only available in seven states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Texas. Read our review. Startups with no credit history can get business credit cards because most issuers require a personal guarantee. That means if your business cant repay the debt, youll personally have to. As long as your credit history doesnt make you look like a risky bet to hold up that end of the deal, you should be able to get a business credit card for a new business. Your new businesss structure also wont stop you from getting most small-business credit cards. Many cards are available to sole proprietors, not just LLCs or corporations. However, if your startup falls into one of those buckets, you may want to weigh the differences between corporate credit cards and small-business credit cards to find the best fit. Most new businesses can benefit from a business credit card. A card used wisely can help your business establish good credit a necessity for future small-business financing and offer working capital for a startup. Even if your new business is just a side gig, a business credit card can keep your personal and business spending separate, which youll appreciate at tax time.  MORE: Who can apply for a business credit card? Know your credit score. To qualify for most business credit cards, youll need to have good to excellent personal credit (typically a FICO score of 690 or above). If your personal credit is thin or poor, business credit cards for bad credit are available. You can get a free credit score from many sources, including NerdWallet. Look at your spending to find the best card. For example, if you or your employees travel often, consider a card with hotel or flight rewards. New businesses without months of receipts can look at future costs, such as opening an office. A card with bonus cash back on office supplies could make sense in that case. If youll use your card like a startup business loan, a long 0% APR introductory offer may be the right choice. Check for fees. Every dollar counts for a startup, so you may prefer a business credit card that helps cover your expenses instead of adding to them. Some cards charge annual fees, which may be hundreds of dollars. If the rewards outweigh that cost, paying a fee may be worth it. But there are also a number of business credit cards with no annual fee to choose from. Gather your application materials. To get a business credit card, youll need to provide basic information about yourself, such as your name and Social Security number, and your new business. A formal business structure isnt required for most cards. But in some instances for example, if you want a corporate card for startups youll need to provide company details like an employer identification number. Use your card responsibly. Once you get your new business credit card, you can start spending. Many issuers offer free cards for employees, if you have any, and youll get any rewards tied to their purchases. If this is your first business credit card, work to build business credit by establishing good habits, such as keeping your spending low (20% to 30% of your credit limit) and making on-time payments.
