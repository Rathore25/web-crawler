Our pick for: High-limit corporate card The Brex Card uses factors such as cash flow and spending patterns to offer dynamic credit limits that align with a business's repayment abilities for better or worse. Its a good option when a business owner has a thin credit file but is well-capitalized. The card earns rewards, too. Read our review. Our pick for: High-limit secured business credit card If you can afford to put a lot of money down, the First National Bank Business Edition Secured Visa Card may be a good choice for bad-credit borrowers. Your security deposit will earn interest, and First National Bank lets you choose your own credit limit between $2,000 and $100,000 (in multiples of $50) when you apply. This card charges a $39 annual fee. Read our review. Business credit card issuers determine your credit limit based on your ability to pay. Providers can evaluate this standard differently, but information that may affect their decision includes: Your personal income and debt. Your personal credit score. Your businesss credit history. Your businesss annual income. Your businesss estimated monthly credit card spending. Understanding these factors and potentially improving them before you apply will put you in the best position to get a high-limit business credit card. If youre approved for a card with a lower limit than you want, see if you can provide the issuer with additional business information to receive a larger line of credit.  MORE: How to get a business credit card Many business credit cards dont publish a maximum limit. But options with large annual fees or generous reward rates may give you the highest limit because these cards are meant for big spenders or customers with excellent credit. Some providers do share the minimum credit line that approved applicants will receive though this is a starting point and you could qualify for a larger amount. Here are some well-known issuers business credit cards with the highest minimum limits: Business Credit Card Minimum Credit Limit Ink Business Preferred Credit Card $5,000 Capital One Spark Cash for Business $5,000 Wells Fargo Business Platinum $2,500 Discover it Business Card $500 American Express offers multiple business credit cards but does not share its minimum credit limit. The Business Platinum Card from American Express, however, is among its offerings with no preset limit, which means your spending limit is flexible and the amount you can spend adapts based on factors such as your purchase, payment, and credit history. This type of card may be a good choice if you want a high limit because your costs vary. Be sure to compare all of a cards terms and features to find the right choice for your business. For example, the Capital One Spark Cash Select for Business has a lower minimum limit ($2,000) than the Capital One Spark Cash for Business, but it lacks the $95 annual fee the latter card charges after your first year. Also, remember that limits arent set in stone. If you handle your account responsibly or your financial situation improves you can always request a higher credit limit. Last updated on June 4, 2021 NerdWallet's credit cards team selects the best cards in each category based on overall consumer value. Factors in our evaluation include fees, promotional and ongoing APRs, and sign-up bonuses; for rewards cards, we consider earning and redemption rates, redemption options and redemption difficulty.

<TITLE>Online Business Loans 2021: Compare Your Options</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Work with our lending specialists to get smart answers to all your small business questions. Best of all, its completely free. Best Of Online lenders often provide faster and easier access to small-business loans than banks, though at higher rates. Online business loans have become a popular financing option over the past decade as banks have scaled back on loans to small businesses. With the help of algorithms and technology, online lenders analyze traditional credit standards, such as personal credit score and cash flow, and may also use nontraditional metrics, including social media interactions and online customer reviews. As a result, they can offer quicker and easier access to capital than traditional lenders like banks and credit unions. Borrowing costs, though, are typically higher for online business loans. Borrowing from online lenders isnt for everyone, however. If your business is just getting started, you probably wont qualify. Youll have to consider other startup-financing options. But if youve been in business at least a year and need quick access to cash or cant qualify for a bank loan, online small-business loans are worth exploring. You can compare online financing options by product below: term loans, lines of credit and invoice factoring. For pandemic-related aid, small businesses have a few options, including Paycheck Protection Program loans, which received new funding in late December. with Fundera by Nerdwallet Our picks for Online business term loans with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 6.99 - 24.99% 650 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 12.18 - 36.00% 660 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 9.00 - 99.00% 600 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: Our picks for Business lines of credit with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 15.00 - 78.00% 650 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 11.00 - 61.90% 600 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: Our pick for Invoice factoring with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 15.00 - 68.00% 530 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet Credibility Capital - Online term loan with Fundera by Nerdwallet Funding Circle - Online term loan with Fundera by Nerdwallet OnDeck - Online term loan with Fundera by Nerdwallet BlueVine - Line of credit with Fundera by Nerdwallet OnDeck - Line of credit with Fundera by Nerdwallet BlueVine - Invoice factoring with Fundera by Nerdwallet Term loans provide a lump sum of cash that you repay over a fixed period. Because you can pay them off over a longer period, term loans are usually the better choice for larger investments and long-term growth. Term loans include the popular SBA 7(a) program, which are loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration but issued by traditional banks and online lenders. If youre looking for financing flexibility, a business line of credit is a better option. You draw on the line up to a specified amount as needed and pay interest only on the money youve borrowed. Lines of credit are a better choice for short-term expenses. Although the APR may be slightly higher than for term loans, lines of credit provide the flexibility to take out money only when, and as often as, you need it. Invoice factoring is a way to get immediate cash by borrowing against your unpaid customer invoices, which can help you fill cash-flow gaps while you wait for customers to pay. This type of financing is only for companies that sell goods and services to other businesses and, therefore, have invoices. Typically, invoice factoring costs are higher than with term loans and lines of credit. To help you compare loan options, NerdWallet has a list of small-business loans that are best for business owners. All of our recommendations are based on the lenders market scope and track record and on the needs of business owners, as well as rates and other factors, so you can make the right financing decision.

Work with our lending specialists to get smart answers to all your small business questions. Best of all, its completely free. Best Of Inventory financing can help your small business purchase products to meet customer demand. Compare inventory lines of credit and term loans. Inventory financing refers to a line of credit or term loan that a small-business owner uses to purchase products to sell. It can help keep your shelves stocked during a busy season, or allow you to buy products in bulk at a discount. Lines of credit offer more flexibility than term loans and work best for financing ongoing inventory purchases. You get a set amount of money you can tap into as needed, and you pay back only what youve borrowed. Term loans may have higher borrowing amounts and longer repayment periods, making them a better choice for financing large, one-time inventory purchases. Weve rounded up the best inventory loans based on financing type.

<TITLE>Long-Term Business Loans: Financing for Growth</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Work with our lending specialists to get smart answers to all your small business questions. Best of all, its completely free. Best Of Long-term business loans provide financing with repayment terms up to 10 years; up to 25 years in some cases. When your business is looking to expand or make a large investment, a long-term business loan is the way to go. The benefits of long-term loans include more time to repay and lower monthly payments than youll find with short-term business loans. The challenge: It may be harder to qualify because youll likely need an established business and strong finances. As with any small-business loan, always compare the costs and terms of each loan carefully. with Fundera by Nerdwallet Our pick for Long-term business loans up to 5 years with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 12.18 - 36.00% 660 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet Funding Circle - Online term loan with Fundera by Nerdwallet SBA loans: The government-backed small-business loans typically have the lowest rates and the longest repayment terms in the market. You work with U.S. Small Business Administration-approved banks and other lenders to qualify for these long-term business loans up to $5 million. Typical repayment period is 10 years for SBA loans for working capital and equipment, and up to 25 years for large assets such as land and facilities. Bank loans: Traditional lenders provide long-term business loans with repayment terms between five to seven years. Interest rates range based on your qualifications. Besides big banks, you can apply for a long-term bank loan at your community bank or credit union. Alternative business loans: If you don't qualify for a SBA or bank loan, or you want funding faster, consider loans from alternative lenders, such as Funding Circle or Currency. Both online lenders provide repayments terms up to five years. One major difference between a long-term business loan and a short-term business loan is monthly repayment costs. For example, a $100,000 term loan with an 10% annual percentage rate would require monthly payments of $1,322 over 10 years, while the same loan with a five-year term would require monthly payments of $2,125. Figure out your loans monthly payment and costs by using NerdWallets business loan calculator. NerdWallet has created a comparison tool of the best small-business loans to meet your needs and goals.

<TITLE>Equipment Financing: Best Business Loan Options</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Work with our lending specialists to get smart answers to all your small business questions. Best of all, its completely free. Best Of Banks and online lenders offer equipment loans to help finance costly equipment purchases for businesses. Equipment financing is a type of small-business loan designed specifically for the purchase of machinery and equipment essential to running your business. You can use an equipment loan to purchase anything from office furniture and medical equipment to farm machinery or commercial ovens. Keep reading to learn more about equipment financing and compare your business equipment loan options. with Fundera by Nerdwallet Our picks for Equipment loans for items under $50,000 with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 9.00 - 99.00% 600 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 6.99 - 24.99% 650 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: Our pick for Equipment loans for items $50,000 and over with Fundera by Nerdwallet with Fundera by Nerdwallet 12.18 - 36.00% 660 Key Facts Pros & Cons Product Details Pros Cons Qualifications: with Fundera by Nerdwallet OnDeck - Online term loan with Fundera by Nerdwallet Credibility Capital - Online term loan with Fundera by Nerdwallet Funding Circle - Online term loan with Fundera by Nerdwallet With equipment financing, the loan amount you qualify for depends on the value of the equipment you are purchasing. The equipment also serves as collateral for the loan, so the lender can seize it if you fail to repay the loan. Traditional banks typically offer the most favorable interest rates and terms, but they have strict credit standards. Online small-business lenders are another equipment financing option, especially if you need to purchase equipment quickly or if your personal and business finances arent in excellent shape. The size of the loan should match the price of the equipment youre purchasing, while the loan term should match how long you expect to use the new equipment. If youre buying commercial ovens that you expect to use for 10 years years, get a loan with a 10-year term. A shorter term may have you scrambling to make payments, and a longer term means youll be paying for the equipment after you stop using it. Some lenders may require an equipment loan to finance heavy-duty vehicles, whereas others offer business auto loans or semi truck financing to cover such purchases. Compare options to find the best fit for your business. Equipment loan interest rates are typically between 8% and 30%. Where your rate will fall in that range depends on your credit score, business revenue and time in business, as well as the equipment youre financing. Established businesses with excellent financials could secure a rate below 8%, for example. While startups and business owners with bad credit (a FICO score between 300 and 629) will likely have a higher interest rate. The main benefit of financing large equipment purchases is that it leaves working capital free for day-to-day operations. But there are other things to consider, such as the length of the loan and whether youll need a down payment. Here are some pros and cons to consider: PROS CONS Many vendors offer leasing as a financing alternative. Equipment leasing can help reduce costs and maximize an investment. For instance, a piece of equipment becomes less valuable and productive as it gets older, so leasing it for a limited time may be a smart move. Some financing companies also offer the option of buying the equipment at current market value. Leasing generally is more costly than buying if you end up using the equipment for a long time. According to the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association, leasing is likely the preferable option for equipment you plan to use for 36 months or less. If youll use it for longer, it makes more sense to buy. To recap our selections... Andrew L. Wang is a former content strategist and small-business writer for NerdWallet.

Work with our lending specialists to get smart answers to all your small business questions. Best of all, its completely free. Best Of Online lenders provide short-term business loans starting at three months. Compare options for good- and bad-credit borrowers. Short-term business loans can give your business the fast cash it needs to bridge cash-flow gaps, handle emergencies and other immediate financing needs, or take advantage of a business opportunity. Think of them as quick-turnaround loans: Borrow what you can pay back relatively quickly so you can focus on running your business rather than managing debt. Here are short-term financing options from online business lenders. We always recommend comparing small-business loans from multiple loan providers.

Because you have a shorter repayment period, your monthly payment (which includes interest and any fees) will be higher than a long-term business loan, which can have repayment terms of up to 25 years in some cases. While short-term business loans provide fast cash, they do come with some disadvantages, including: NerdWallet has created a comparison tool of the best small-businessloans to meet your needs and goals. We gauged factors including lender trustworthiness, market scope and user experience, and arranged them by categories that include revenue and how long youve been in business. To recap our selections... A short-term business loan provides a lump sum upfront to a borrower and has a repayment period ranging from three months to three years. The short repayment period means this type of financing is best to manage an immediate cash flow gap, an emergency or immediate financing needs. Besides a short-term business loan, you can turn to other financing options. Business credit cards can offer immediate funding, especially if you need smaller amounts than what a business term loan would provide. If you have a business with unpaid invoices, you can turn to invoice financing to turn them into cash. Steve Nicastro is a former NerdWallet writer and authority on personal loans and small business.

Clover Station Starts at $1,349 Full countertop POS system. Clover Station Pro Starts at $1,649 Full countertop POS system with consumer-facing display. Clover Go is the most portable of the Clover POS hardware options. This piece of Clover point of sale hardware is a Bluetooth-enabled smart device attachment that allows your business to process magstripe-only cards, chip cards and contactless payments. However, unlike other Clover POS system hardware options, Clover Go requires an iOS or Android device to work. It's $69, making it the most affordable hardware option. The Clover Flex is a handheld point-of-sale piece of hardware that offers a remarkable amount of capabilities for its size. It can process all payments, capture customer signatures, scan bar codes and print receipts, all on the go. Among mobile POS options, it's a standout choice. It retails for $499. This is the first fully countertop option in the Clover POS system hardware offerings. The small, powerful hardware option, which starts at $749, is relatively affordable compared with other countertop systems. Youll be able to process all payments speedily, scan bar codes and print receipts. The Clover Station system, which starts at $1,349, allows you the same great capabilities as the Clover Mini, but with more speed. It also includes a cash drawer and receipt printer. With this option, youll get the Clover Station with a second, customer-facing touch-screen display. This can help provide a better customer experience say, for example, if you want your customer to be able to review their order as you're completing a sale. This option starts at $1,649. With a Clover POS system, everything comes included: the software, hardware and payment processing. Except for the Clover Go, you can also use these systems without relying on a smartphone or tablet. If you want to keep things simple, purchasing these goods and services as a bundle is appealing. Clovers payment processing rates are reasonable when compared with competitors. The 2.7% + $0.10 transaction rate on Clover's Register Lite plan is roughly the same as PayPal and Stripe (and slightly more than Square). The Register plan comes with a lower rate of 2.3% + $0.10, which beats most other competitors. Whats more, the Clover Flex POS and Clover Mini POS can be had for under $750. With many businesses, youll need to spend upward of $1,000 to get yourself a complete set of POS hardware. Clovers affordability cant be overlooked. Clover's hardware operates with great speed and ease and can be set up for a variety of different business purposes, including for restaurants, retail outlets and services. Its functionality and versatility might be enough to justify the higher prices on the more elaborate setups, like the Station Pro. Unlike some POS systems, the Clover POS doesnt offer any free hardware options. This means that, on top of payment processing fees, your business will have to shell out a lump sum for a piece of Clover POS hardware, no matter how simple your payment processing needs are. Compare that to Square, which offers a free mobile credit card reader to all new merchants. Square POS addresses the imperfections that Clover POS systems tend to suffer. Not only does Square POS offer a free magstripe reader, but it also offers a free version of Square POS software that comes with inventory management capabilities. Squares fees are also similar to what youd get with Clovers Register Lite plan, and you can add a variety of features to your Square POS, such as payroll processing and a customer loyalty program. on Square's website While the Clover POS is relatively affordable, its payment processing fees arent the lowest available. For cheaper payments, consider Payment Depot. Payment Depot is a merchant services provider that provides membership pricing and wholesale interchange rates. Memberships range from $49 to $199. With your membership, youll get the interchange rate plus transaction fees ranging between $0.05 and $0.15. Whats more, Payment Depot resells several of Clovers POS systems, including the Flex, Mini and Station. Other tools include a payment gateway and virtual terminal. If you go with Clover, you have no choice but to process payments through Fiserv, even if you choose to work with a different merchant services provider, such as Payment Depot. Customer reviews on Fiserv vary widely, but its not uncommon to hear customers complaining about hidden fees, arbitrary account holds and early termination fees. Clover also has many resellers, which means similar business owners can get widely different terms, depending on which reseller they work with. If you look on review websites, youll find customers describing Clover as a scam more than once potentially because they got a raw deal from a reseller. If you buy from a reseller, read customer reviews and ask questions about the terms beforehand to avoid getting blindsided. If you're looking for a POS system with great hardware options and an easy-to-use system, a Clover POS is a good choice. Despite some imperfections, it offers functionality and quality at prices that wont break the bank. on Square's website Square POS Free and up. Read Review. Toast POS Free and up. Clover POS $9.95 per month and up. Lightspeed POS $69 per month (billed annually) and up. QuickBooks POS Free and up.

Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Radius offers an interest-earning business checking account great for ATM accessibility and robust digital banking tools. With unlimited ATM fee reimbursements and the ability to earn interest, the Radius Tailored Checking account provides benefits similar to those offered with Radius' consumer banking products. For small-business owners, however, this online business checking account stands out because it offers account holders unlimited transactions, debit card rewards, as well as convenient digital banking tools including bill pay, integrated invoicing and accounting reports. Want an interest-earning business checking account with unlimited transactions. Can maintain a $5,000 account balance to accrue interest and waive the $10 monthly fee.

Although Radius is known as an online bank, the company, headquartered in Boston, does have four proprietary ATMs in the city, as well as two locations there, in addition to the corporate office. Radius also has a Small Business Administration lending office in Chicago. So unlike some online business checking accounts that have banking services actually provided by other financial institutions the Tailored Checking account is provided by Radius directly. To open a Tailored Checking account, youll complete an online application on the Radius website and provide information about you, your business and any other business owners. Before submitting your application, you also will need to link an existing bank account or debit card in order to fund your new account, pending approval. To be eligible, you must be at least 18 years old, a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and have a valid U.S. address. Once youve submitted your application, the review process generally takes anywhere from two to five business days. After you receive approval from Radius, youll be able to log in to online banking, as well as download the mobile app, to set up and manage your checking account. Youll also receive your Radius business debit card within seven to 10 days and you can contact customer service to request additional cards for employees. Unlimited transactions: With the Radius business checking account, you receive unlimited fee-free transactions, including deposits, ACH payments, ATM transactions and account transfers. This also includes the ability to deposit cash fee-free at participating MoneyPass and NYCE ATMs a feature not offered by all online-based business checking accounts. Earns interest: As long as you maintain a balance of $5,000 or more, you can earn 0.10% APY on your Radius business account. And, if you dont have the funds or dont want to be limited by the Federal Reserves six-per-month transaction limit for a separate business savings account, Radius Tailored Checking still offers you the chance to earn interest on your business funds. Fee-free ATM access: Radius doesnt charge any ATM fees, regardless of the ATM you use. Although Radius offers in-network ATM access through the MoneyPass and SUM networks, it doesn't charge fees for out-of-network ATM-use. In fact, the Tailored Checking account includes unlimited rebates for ATM fees that you incur from other banks worldwide (although international currency exchange fees aren't covered) a perk not offered by all online-based business checking accounts. Debit card rewards program: The Radius business checking account gives you the ability to earn an unlimited 1% cash back on online and signature-based credit transactions (where you select credit instead of debit at an in-store point of sale terminal) made with your debit card provided you maintain an average monthly balance of $5,000 or more. Additionally, for a limited time, you can earn an extra 0.5% cash back on business-related spending categories, such as advertising, computer equipment and computer services. This unique Radius-specific program offers an easy opportunity to earn cash back on everyday spending. Digital banking tools: With Radius business checking, you receive access to online and mobile banking tools that allow you to manage your finances regardless of location. Using these tools, you can pay bills, make deposits, send transfers, add and manage users and order physical business checks. In addition to these features, Tailored Checking stands out from competitors with Autobooks the integrated invoicing and online payment software included with your account. Autobooks gives you the ability to create and send invoices, accept payments from customers, monitor invoice and payment activity, as well as generate balance sheet and general ledger reports. Account minimum required to access perks: Although technically the Radius business checking account doesn't have a minimum balance requirement in other words, you wont face a penalty fee for your balance dropping below a certain threshold you do need to be able to maintain a balance of $5,000 to access many of the benefits this account has to offer. If you cant regularly maintain a $5,000 balance, you wont be able to earn interest on your account, access the debit card rewards program or waive the $10 monthly maintenance fee. Low APY: With this Radius business account, youll earn 0.10% APY on your balance of $5,000 and higher. That said, although its impressive to find an online-based, interest-earning business checking account, this account actually offers a low APY compared with similar alternatives. As just one example, Axos Banks Business Interest Checking account has comparable features $100 minimum opening deposit, $5,000 minimum balance required to waive a $10 monthly fee, unlimited domestic ATM fee reimbursements with a much higher APY. The Axos account earns APY on a tiered-structure, with rates ranging from 0.81% to 0.20% based on your balance. Additional fees: On top of the monthly maintenance fee, Radius charges certain service fees associated with the use of your Tailored Checking account. Youll pay a $25 fee for incidents including stop payments, returned items, and nonsufficient funds, as well as wiring fees which vary depending on whether the wire is incoming or outgoing and domestic or international. Although these types of service fees are standard among business checking accounts from brick-and-mortar banks, many online-based competitors are able to offer fewer fees, particularly when it comes to incidental fees.

For general account issues, customer service is available Monday through Saturday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET. For assistance with business online banking and bill pay, customer support is available 24/7 and for direct pay, representatives are available Monday through Sunday from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. PT. To open a new Wells Fargo business checking account, representatives are available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. CT. Moreover, you can use Wells Fargos automated telephone banking service at any time, with free, unlimited access to your accounts. Wells Fargo does not charge any fees to speak to a customer service representative over the phone. Monthly fees: Although all three Wells Fargo business checking accounts offer ways to waive the monthly maintenance fee, these fees are still something to keep in mind and budget for especially when it comes to the Navigate Business Checking account, where the threshold to waive is a minimum of $10,000, compared with $500 with the Initiate Business Checking account. These types of monthly fees are not uncommon, but there are both brick-and-mortar and online competitors that can offer fee-free account options.  Looking to avoid monthly fees? Use our guide to find a free business checking account Transaction limitations: Each of the Wells Fargo business checking accounts places a limit on the number of fee-free transactions that you can make every month. With the basic-level Initiate Business Checking account, you receive up to 100 fee-free transactions per month, with each additional transaction costing 50 cents. Like monthly fees, these limitations are not uncommon but they are something to look out for, as you may be able to find a business checking account alternative that offers similar features but higher transaction limits. As an example, Bank of Americas entry-level account, Business Advantage Fundamentals Checking, offers up to 200 fee-free transactions per month, with each additional transaction costing 45 cents. Plus, Bank of America does not charge an excess transaction fee for ACH transfers, debit card transactions, electronic debits and mobile or online check deposit. Alternatively, if you want to avoid these limitations altogether, online competitors like BlueVine or NBKC can offer business checking accounts with unlimited fee-free transactions. Incidental fees: Wells Fargo can charge a variety of incidental fees associated with the use of your business checking account. Wells Fargo charges a $35 overdraft and returned items fee, $31 stop payment fee, as well as wire fees that range from $15 to $45, depending on the type of wire. In addition, Wells Fargo will charge a fee for using your business debit card at non-Wells Fargo ATMs. Youll face a $2.50 fee for transactions in the U.S. and a $5 fee for international transactions. You may also face a fee from the owner of the ATM on top of these fees from Wells Fargo. With the Navigate and Optimize Business Checking accounts, Wells Fargo waives some of these fees, which is not the case with the Initiate Business Checking account. at Chase, Member FDIC at Radius, Member FDIC Monthly fee $15 (multiple ways to waive) Monthly fee $10 (waived with balance of $5,000+) Monthly fee $10 for Initiate, $25 for Navigate and $75 for Optimize Business Checking.

If youre considering a credit union business account, the following questions can help you decide which is the best fit for you. Can you join? Credit unions are membership-based organizations, so youll have to be eligible to bank with one. Some credit unions have fairly relaxed requirements such as making a small donation to a specific organization. But many others limit their eligibility pool to those who live in a certain area, work for a specific employer or are related to someone who meets those criteria. How will you bank? If youre not joining your neighborhood credit union, youll still want easy access to your money. Check that the credit union participates in ATM- or branch-sharing networks with locations near you and offers an app with services like e-deposit and bill pay. Some credit unions have smaller footprints including online and may require an in-person visit to set up your business account or prevent you from opening an account if your business is outside their geographic domain. Do its features stack up? Credit unions may offer higher rates on deposits and emphasize customer service more than traditional banks. But make sure a credit unions specific business account has benefits that stand out for you, especially if you opt for a provider that isnt convenient. If you wont bank much in person, look at online business accounts as well because they may offer even lower fees or better rates. What other products are available? Some business owners prefer to bank with a single financial institution. If thats your goal, make sure the credit union you choose offers business solutions for your immediate and future needs. For example, youll likely need small-business financing at some point. By building a relationship with a credit union now, your chances of getting a loan down the line may improve.

<TITLE>Best Business Savings Accounts of June 2021 - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. The best business savings accounts are high-yield accounts that allow you to earn more money over time. A business savings account is a type of business bank account that allows you to earn interest on your funds. Compared with business checking accounts, savings accounts typically limit your monthly withdrawals, making them best for long-term savings like emergency funds as opposed to everyday use. The best business savings accounts are high-yield accounts those with above-average interest rates that allow you to earn more money over time. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the national average annual percentage yield, or APY, on a savings account is currently 0.05%. Although interest rates are subject to change, youll find that online business savings accounts can generally offer higher rates compared with accounts from brick-and-mortar banks. Here are some of the top business savings accounts for high-yield savings: Account APY Minimum opening deposit Monthly fee Live Oak Business Savings 0.55% $0 $0 First Internet Bank Business Money Market Savings 0.40% with a daily balance of $10 million or below; 0.25% with a daily balance above $10 million $100 $5, waived with average daily balance of $4,000 TAB Bank Business Money Market 0.25% $25 $0 Axos Business Savings 0.20% $1,000 $5, waived with average daily balance of $2,500 NBKC Business Money Market 0.05% $0 $0  MORE: How to open a business bank account The Live Oak Business Savings account is an online-based account with no monthly maintenance fees and no minimum balance requirements. This account starts earning interest 0.55% APY with a balance of 1 cent. This business savings account also includes free online banking, access to the Live Oak Bank mobile app and six fee-free withdrawals per month ($10 for each after that). You can transfer funds to your Live Oak Business Savings account by ACH payment, mobile check deposit, mailed check or wire deposit. Live Oak does not accept cash deposits or offer ATM access with this account. The Business Money Market Savings account from First Internet Bank can be opened with as little as $100 and earns an APY of 0.40% with a daily balance of $10 million or below. For daily balances above $10 million, you'll earn an APY of 0.25%. This online business savings account has a $5 monthly maintenance fee, which can be waived with an average daily balance of $4,000 or more. You can make up to six monthly transactions with this account; any additional transactions incur a $5 fee. This business savings account also includes free online and mobile banking with remote and scanned deposit options, as well as electronic statements. ATM cards, however, are available only to sole proprietorships and not other entity types. Although TAB Bank is well-known in the trucking industry, its business money market account offering a 0.25% APY is available to all small-business owners. This online business savings account has a minimum opening deposit requirement of $25 and starts earning interest with a balance of $1. The account has no monthly fees and includes online, mobile and text banking; online bill pay; account alerts; and automated telephone banking. In addition, youll receive six fee-free withdrawals every month; after that, however, youll incur a $20 fee for each withdrawal. The TAB Bank Business Money Market account also includes checks and an ATM card. Without any in-network ATMs, though, you will have to pay associated fees for withdrawing cash at a third-party ATM. The Axos Business Savings account earns 0.20% APY, requiring a $1,000 minimum opening deposit. This account has a $5 monthly maintenance fee, which can be waived with an average daily balance of $2,500. You receive 20 fee-free items per month with the Axos Business Savings account, including debits, credits and deposited items; after that, each item will cost 30 cents. In addition, this account limits you to six fee-free withdrawals/transfers per month; each excess withdrawal/transfer will cost $10. The Axos Business Savings account does not include a business debit card. To withdraw money, you can either use a wire transfer or an ACH transfer to an eligible business checking account with bill pay. Like allAxos bank accounts, this business savings account can be opened and managed completely online. The account also includes free online and mobile banking with remote deposit anywhere, free image statement and free bill pay. Plus, for small businesses incorporated after June 1, 2020, Axos offers a $100 welcome bonus for opening a new account. To earn this bonus, you must maintain an average daily balance of $2,500 for the first two months after opening your account. Applications must be submitted before June 30, 2021, to qualify. NBKCs Business Money Market account is a free business savings account with no monthly fees and no minimum opening deposit. This account earns 0.05% APY and requires a minimum balance of 1 cent to earn interest. Like the NBKC business checking account, this business savings account includes no transaction fees, no overdraft or nonsufficient funds fees, no stop payment or returned item fees and no fees for incoming domestic wires. The only fees youll face with this online business savings account are for sending domestic wires ($5 each) and sending or receiving international wires ($45 each). In addition, the NBKC Business Money Market account offers free online and mobile banking, which includes bill pay and mobile check deposit. You also have the option to request a business debit card, which can be used fee-free at over 34,000 MoneyPass ATMs across the U.S. You are, however, limited to six account withdrawals per month. There are no fees for excessive withdrawals, but after the first time, youll receive a warning from NBKC. And after the second, your savings account will be turned into a checking account. Business savings accounts and business money market accounts are both FDIC-insured business bank accounts that allow you to earn interest on your funds. Like savings accounts, money market accounts are usually held to the six-per-month withdrawal limit. Traditionally, money market accounts have offered higher interest rates compared with savings accounts, but thats not always the case anymore. However, business money market accounts may be more likely to include a debit or ATM card, as well as checks. Depending on your businesss financial needs, here are some factors that you may want to consider on top of the interest rate to help you choose a business savings account: Minimum opening deposit: How much does it cost to open the account? These requirements can range, but youll want to make sure that you have enough money set aside to open the account. Monthly fees: Is there a monthly fee associated with maintaining the account? Ideally, your business savings account will have low or no fees. Minimum balance requirement: Is there a minimum account balance required to earn the APY? This term might also be used in reference to monthly fees: Is there a minimum account balance required to waive any monthly maintenance fees associated with the account? Make sure that you can sustain minimum balance requirements on an ongoing basis to avoid losing out on interest or, conversely, incurring monthly fees. Monthly withdrawals or transfers: Although the Federal Reserve has removed the requirement that imposes a six-per-month maximum on withdrawals from savings accounts as of April 2020, many banks and credit unions continue to enforce these limits. In some cases, excessive withdrawals may result in your business savings account being transferred to a business checking account. ATM access: Is a business debit card or ATM card included with your savings account, and if so, where can you use it? If youre looking for these features in particular, brick-and-mortar banks may be more likely to offer them compared with online competitors. How to open: Can you open the account online or do you have to visit a branch? Does the bank allow you to choose between the two options in order to open your account?

Operation HOPEs exceptional 4-star rating sets it apart from its peers and demonstrates its trustworthiness to the public, said Michael Thatcher, President & CEO of Charity Navigator. Only a quarter of charities rated by Charity Navigator receive the distinction of our 4-star rating, and a substantially smaller percentage have achieved this distinction seven consecutive times.

We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Choosing a business structure depends on your tolerance for risking your personal assets among other factors. Designing a killer website, prototyping your product, talking your way to your first big order these parts of starting your business likely stir your entrepreneurial passions. The business structure of your new enterprise? Not so exciting. But hold on. Careful consideration of which structure is right for you is crucial because it will have implications for how the IRS taxes your business profits. Itll also determine whether your personal property is protected when others demand money from your business. Other considerations, including the management of the new business and your long-term plans for it, come into play as well. Below, weve outlined types of business structures and what to consider before choosing one. Business structures are largely creations of state law, so there are minor variations on the details from state to state. Here are five common models: An unincorporated business that is owned by one person who reports business profits on his or her individual tax return. A sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure and is straightforward to start. An unincorporated business owned by multiple owners, either people or other businesses. Profits are divided among its owners and reported on their tax returns. Common partnership types include general partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and limited liability limited partnerships (LLLPs). An LLC is a hybrid business structure that limits the personal liability of its owners called members like a corporation but allows the profits to be taxed on either a member level or the corporate level. An S corporation has one class of stock and no more than 100 shareholders, none of whom can be another for-profit business or a person without a green card who doesnt meet IRS residency requirements. Profits are taxed on shareholders tax returns, and shareholders have limited liability. A corporation whose profit is taxed once on the business level and a second time on an individual basis when earnings are distributed to shareholders, who have limited liability for the businesss debts. C corporationscan have multiple classes of stock and an unlimited number of shareholders. Switching business structures is possible, but it's best to decide early onwhich one you'll need for the next few years. It can get complicated not to mention pricey, in terms of legal fees to change structures, and the effort could distract from running your business. When you run a business, youre at greater risk for a lawsuit. Why? Businesses interact with the world other businesses, government, regular people much more than most individuals, and when they do, theres a good chance moneys involved. In a sole proprietorship, if your business is sued and loses, your personal assets real estate, cars, bank accounts can be targets for the parties seeking to collect damages. The same can be said, in some cases, if you default on a business loan and you signed a personal guarantee, or the lender placed a lien on your assets. The lender can attempt to recover its investment from your personal property.  COMPARE: Small-business lenders In a general partnership, creditors can go after any of the partners personal assets to recoup the whole debt. Its different in a limited partnership, where only the general partners are personally liable for the debts of the business, while limited partners are liable for the businesss debts only up to the amount of their investment. More common among lawyers are limited liability partnerships, which limit partners liability for the firms debts but still hold them individually liable for their professional activities. There are also limited liability limited partnerships, a sort of limited partnership that extends limited liability to general partners, not just limited partners. LLCs and corporations limit their members or shareholders liability, so personal assets are protected. Sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations are pass-through entities, as are some LLCs. In a pass-through entity, profits are passed directly to the owners of the business. Come tax time, it is reported on the owners individual returns. By default, the IRS views LLCs as pass-through entities unless they opt to be taxed as a corporation. C corporations are separate entities from their owners, so their profits are taxed at the corporate level. If a corporation pays out dividends, which come out of its after-tax income, shareholders also must pay taxes on their proceeds. If multiple owners are involved, structuring the business can be more complicated. Partnerships are typically governed by agreements that specify how profits from the business are divided among parties and what happens when a partner retires, becomes disabled, declares bankruptcy or dies. An S corporation or C corporation is required by law to have a board of directors to oversee the companys direction on behalf of the shareholders. An LLC structure generally allows the choice between being managed by members or overseen by a management team, which can include members or nonmembers. LLCs typically draw up an operating agreement that specifies roles. For noncorporation business structures, initial paperwork and fees are relatively light, and are simple enough for owners to handle without special expertise (though its a good idea to consult a lawyer or an accountant for help). Ongoing requirements usually come on an annual basis. For S and C corporations, the administrative complexity increases, and you will almost certainly need a lawyer and accountant. In every state, there are tax and legal hoops to jump through for corporations to become and remain compliant. Failure to meet deadlines, pay certain fees and file the proper forms can result in penalties. The right structure doesnt just depend on the state of your business today; it also depends on where you would like to be in three to five years, or even longer. If youre looking for fast growth, which takes cash, C corporations allow for multiple classes of stock and dont restrict the number or type of shareholders. Theyre the best fit if youre seeking investments from venture capitalists, or if you plan on becoming a publicly traded company, rather than a privately owned one, in the near- or mid-term. Another consideration is what happens when you or another owner dies, goes bankrupt or withdraws. Corporations live on after these events, but generally the other types of business structure dissolve unless specified otherwise beforehand.

<TITLE>How to Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. The IRS' online application is the easiest and fastest method to obtain an EIN for your business. If you own a small business, youll likely need to apply for an employer identification number, also known as a business tax ID number, at some point. An employer identification number, or EIN, is a nine-digit number assigned to your company by the IRS, and you use it when filing your business's income tax return or payroll tax return. An EIN also comes in handy when opening a business bank account, applying for a business credit card or applying for a business loan. If you're looking to get an EIN, the good news is that the application process is easy and free. You can apply online on the IRS' website or by mail or fax. (International applicants also have the option to apply by phone.) You only need some basic bits of info about your business in order to apply. Ideally, you should apply for an EIN when you first launch your business, but you might also be applying in time for tax season or to submit a business loan application. The application process is free through the IRS, so be wary of companies that charge you to apply for an EIN on your behalf. Follow these simple instructions to apply for an employer identification number. There are two basic requirements that must be met to apply for an employer identification number: Your principal business must be located in the U.S. or U.S. territories. The person applying must have a valid taxpayer identification number, such as a Social Security number. Your principal business is determined by identifying the main income-generating activity that you do (e.g., consultant, engineer, doctor, auto repair shop) and your main physical location. Just because you provide services outside of the U.S. doesnt necessarily mean that you dont meet the eligibility requirements. As long as your primary business activities are in the U.S., you are eligible to apply for an EIN. The person who submits the application doesn't need to be the business owner. The applicant can be a partner or officer of the company. The IRS allows any "responsible party" to apply, which they define as anyone who manages the company's finances. Another individual, such as a secretary or assistant, can also apply provided that a responsible party signs Form SS-4and fills out the third-party designee section. You should start by reviewing the PDF version of Form SS-4: Application for Employer Identification Number. That way, you can ensure that you have all the required information ready, such as names, addresses and the Social Security number of the responsible party. Youll need to know what type of business entity your company is, and if your business is a corporation, you'll have to put down the state or country where you incorporated. If you have a multi-member LLC, make sure you know the number of members. Other information youll need to complete the application include: Primary reason for applying (e.g., launching a business, banking purposes, hiring employees, etc.). Date you started or acquired your business. Primary industry, along with a description of your primary product or service. Highest number and type of employees you expect to employ during the next 12 months. First date wages were or will be paid in your business. Closing month of your accounting or fiscal year (typically December if you are a calendar-year taxpayer). Whether you'd like to file an annual employer tax return instead of a quarterly employer tax return if you pay your employees $4,000 or less in wages in a calendar year. (Consult your accountant for this part of the application.) By reviewing and filling out Form SS-4, you can make sure you have all the information you need ready to go before you begin the online application process. The IRS has a few options to apply for an EIN. You can apply online, by fax or by mail. Applicants who are currently overseas and seeking to immigrate to the U.S. for business purposes can also choose to apply by phone. For all U.S.-based applicants, the online application is the easiest and fastest method. For the online application, the IRS' online EIN assistant offers an easy step-by-step form. The online application is availableMonday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. EST. The assistant walks you through the application process and provides links to help resources and other information.Keep in mind that youll automatically be logged out of the system after 15 minutes for security reasons, and each responsible party is only able to apply for one EIN per business day. If you use the IRS' online application, you will receive your EIN instantly once you electronically submit your application. Fax applications take four business days to process. Mailed applications take four weeks. Should you choose to get an EIN via fax or mail, you'll have to send in the completedForm SS-4.

Any business that has employees is required to have an EIN to pay and file payroll taxes for their employees. In addition, businesses that are structured as partnerships, corporations or multi-member LLCs are also required to have an employer identification number to file a business income tax return. The only types of businesses that don't need an EIN are sole proprietorshipswith no employees and single-member LLCs with no employees that are taxed as disregarded entities. If you fall into one of these categories, then you can use your Social Security number when filing income taxes instead of an EIN. Certain specific types of organizational structures also require an EIN. If your organization is defined as any of the following types, youll need to apply for an EIN regardless of whether you have employees: Trusts, except certain grantor-owned revocable trusts, IRAs and Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Returns. Businesses that pay excise, alcohol, tobacco or firearm taxes. Businesses with a Keogh plan. Estates. Real estate mortgage investment conduits. Nonprofit organizations. Farmers' cooperatives. Plan administrators. Keep in mind that even if the IRS doesn't require you to get an EIN, U.S.-based businesses have the option to apply for one. And getting one comes with several benefits. Having this identifying number allows you to separate your business and personal finances and easily apply for business credit, open a business bank account and work with suppliers without having to use your personal Social Security number. Here are some common situations in which you'll need to apply for a new EIN: Your business structure has changed. For example, you'll need a new EIN if you are a sole proprietor and decide to incorporate or take on a partner in your business. You are subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. You purchase an existing business or inherit a business that you operate as a sole proprietorship. If you are merely changing the name of your business or opening a new location for your existing business, you generally wont need to reapply for an employer identification number. If you lose or misplace your EIN, no need to panic or run out and apply for a new one. There are a number of ways to look up your business tax ID: Find the computer-generated notice you received when you applied for an EIN. If you opened a bank account using the EIN, contact your bank to retrieve it. Find your EIN on a previously filed tax return. Many business service providers require your EIN when you sign up for services, such as insurance companies, merchant service providers or your tax professional. You could reach out to one of these to see if they can provide it. Contact the IRS Business & Specialty Tax Line during business hours if you're unable to find your identification number through other methods.

<TITLE>8 Best Business Auto Loans of 2021 - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Banks and alternative lenders offer business auto loans for cars, vans and trucks. If your company relies on one or more vehicles, a business auto loan can be an affordable way to buy a car, van or truck or refinance one you already own to save money. Business and commercial auto loans come with built-in collateral: the vehicle itself. That means they may cost less or be easier to qualify for than other loans, and depending on the lender, you may not have to provide a personal guarantee to secure the debt. You can use other small-business loans to finance a vehicle, so compare options to find the best fit for you. Here are lenders that offer business auto loans and how to decide if one makes sense for you. Small-business bank loans typically have the lowest rates. If you already have a business account with a bank, see what rate it will offer you on a business auto loan. Best for: Business owners who want time to shop around for a vehicle. Annual percentage rates, or APRs, for Bank of America Business Advantage Auto Loans start at 2.99%. Loan amounts range from $10,000 to $100,000 and can be used to purchase or refinance cars, vans or light trucks. If you havent found the right vehicle yet, Bank of America locks in your business auto loan rate offer for 30 days. This gives you time to shop around before you commit to a loan. Best for: Flexible auto leases and no personal guarantees. Ally Bank offers multiple business auto funding options, including specific loans for heavy-duty trucks and vehicle modifications, like adding towing equipment. If youre looking for a traditional vehicle like a passenger car, you can buy or lease through Ally. Leases can be open- or closed-ended. This choice will determine how much you pay at the end of the lease, giving you some flexibility with future costs. If you can qualify, Ally offers business-name-only financing. That means you may not be held personally responsible for the auto loan in instances of nonpayment. Best for: Low-cost loans. Wells Fargo has temporarily suspended its Equipment Express Loan program to focus on Paycheck Protection Program loans. The Equipment Express Loan typically lets you finance or refinance passenger vehicles as well as trucks and trailers from $10,000 to $100,000, with fixed rates starting at 4.50%. If you need a heavy-duty vehicle, Wells Fargo offers semi truck financing via a separate commercial loan program. Wells Fargo does not charge documentation fees for its Equipment Express Loan, but look at APRs when comparing business loan rates. These include interest and fees, so you can tell which business auto loan is the least expensive overall. Best for: Businesses older than two years. Capital One business auto loans offer funding starting at $10,000. Its repayment terms last up to five years. Thats less than other bank auto loans; Bank of America and Wells Fargo each offer 72-month terms. However, NerdWallet recommends avoiding car loans longer than 60 months. You must have or open a business checking account with Capital One to qualify for its business auto loans. You must also have been in business for at least two years. Other lenders may require less time in business for auto loans. Best for: Existing Chase customers. Chase offers sparse details on its business auto loans. Used and new commercial vehicles qualify, and you can use loans for financing or refinancing eligible costs. Alternative lenders are nonbank financing options. These lenders may charge more, but their vehicle loans can make sense if you cant qualify with a bank or need money quickly. Best for: Same-day funding for commercial trucks. Balboa Capital is an alternative lender that specializes in equipment financing. It offers commercial truck loans of up to $250,000 for vans, flatbeds and other vehicles. Many alternative lenders provide faster funding than banks, and Balboa is no exception. The lender says it can provide same-day financing, letting you hit the road in a hurry. To qualify, youll need one year in business and at least $100,000 in annual revenue. All credit scores are considered, making Balboa a potential option if your credit is less than perfect. Best for: Hard-to-finance trucks or specialty vehicles. Crest Capital is an alternative lender that offers business auto loans of up to $1 million. Crest is a good choice if the vehicle you want to buy or lease wont qualify for traditional funding. For example, lenders often have strict criteria around a vehicles mileage or age and may approve purchases from certain dealers only. Crest has no such restrictions; it considers most new or used trucks, vans or specialty vehicles like limos, including those sold by private parties. Best for: Startups or borrowers with bad credit. National Funding is an alternative lender with commercial vehicle financing and leasing of up to $150,000. Its eligibility criteria are less strict than other business auto loan providers, allowing more business owners to potentially qualify. For example, National Funding may be a fit for startup financing as it requires only six months in business. Credit requirements are also more lenient than other lenders its minimum FICO score is 575 making National Funding a good choice for bad credit small-business loans. A business auto loan sometimes called a commercial auto loan is financing you can use to buy a vehicle for your company. These loans typically cover cars, vans and some trucks. Youll likely need an equipment loan or commercial truck loan for a heavy-duty vehicle. Business auto loans are similar to personal auto loans: You get money to buy a car and repay that amount plus interest over a set term. But there are some notable differences: The vehicle is for business purposes. Small-business owners personal and professional lives often blur, but business auto loans are meant for company use. When you apply, the lender will likely ask how youll use the vehicle and you may need to provide documentation like a business plan or company financial statements. The vehicle can be in your businesss name. For qualified borrowers, some lenders will let you put a business auto loan in your companys name only. This can protect your personal credit or assets should your business be unable to repay the debt. In other instances, youll need to provide a personal guarantee for the loan as collateral. Potential tax deductions are available. If you buy or lease a business vehicle, you can deduct its ownership and operation costs. Owners can also deduct a cars depreciation. There are multiple ways to do this; section 179 of the tax code allows the entire deduction all at once, though that amount varies based on factors like vehicle type.  MORE: Car loan calculator Find the right vehicle. This means not only the type of vehicle that fits your businesss needs, but also one a lender will approve. For example, if you want to finance a used car, many lenders will have specific mileage limits and wont approve a vehicle thats more than five years old due to the depreciation. Compare offers. If your company has a relationship with a financial institution, it can make sense to see if it offers business auto loans. But as with other types of business loans, you may pay less by shopping around. Look at a lenders APR and details like how much you can finance. If its less than 100% of the vehicles total cost dont forget expenses like taxes and registration youll need more cash on hand. Apply with a lender. Lenders will have different application procedures. The process may be time-consuming and require paperwork like a business license, business tax ID and information about all the businesss owners. If youre in a rush, alternative lenders may offer a more streamlined application process, but also more expensive loans. Lenders may offer business auto leases and loans. Consider a loan if you want to own the vehicle outright in the long run. But a business auto lease may make sense if: You need to free up cash flow. If youre worried about fitting a cars costs into your operating budget, auto lease payments are often lower than loan payments. You may also be able to spread the sales tax over the repayment term, depending on where you live. But you could pay more in insurance for a lease, as well as overall. You dont want to be stuck with a car. If having the latest car model is important to your business, a lease gives you the opportunity to switch to a new car at the end of your term. You also have options to get out of a car lease like swapping it for a new one if the vehicle doesnt end up fitting your companys needs. You know how youll use the car. Your lease agreement will dictate what you can do with the vehicle, both in terms of how many miles you can drive and whether you do simple modifications, like wrap the outside. If you plan to substantially upfit the car, or run it into the ground, buying may be the better option.  MORE: Car lease calculator In addition to a business auto lease, other alternatives to business auto loans include: Small-business loans. You could use funds from a term loan, SBA loan or business line of credit to finance a company car. But tying up other available working capital like this in a vehicle may not make sense depending on your businesss other needs. Consumer auto loan. If you cant qualify for a business auto loan or your vehicle will be driven more for personal use, consider a consumer auto loan. This wont come with benefits like building business credit, but personal auto loans are widely available, even if you have bad credit. Personal business loan. You can typically use the proceeds from a personal business loan on whatever your company needs including vehicles. But these loans will likely be more expensive than any other business auto loan option, making them a last resort for financing a vehicle purchase.

<TITLE>8 Best Semi Truck Financing Options of 2021 - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Your choice of loans for commercial trucks depends on the vehicle, your credit and your businesss history. You can get semi truck financing from many lenders, including some that focus entirely on big rig lending. Like any small-business loan, the best commercial truck loan will be the least expensive one you can qualify for whether you need a single Sprinter or a fleet of flatbeds. Here are banks and alternative lenders that offer semi truck financing, as well as details on how to qualify and when to consider leasing vehicles instead. Bank small-business loans typically have low costs, but approvals can be time-consuming and tough especially for a business like trucking that has seen increased risk in recent years. Consider these banks if your credit is good (a score in at least the high 600s) and your company has been around for multiple years. Best for: Multiple funding options. Wells Fargo has a commercial vehicle program that offers multiple types of semi truck financing, including term loans, equipment lines of credit and standard and open-ended leases, allowing you to find the option that best fits your businesss needs. Loans are available for trucks, trailers and specialty vehicles, such as tow trucks or cranes. Repayment terms depend on the vehicle. For example, truck loans can last from 12 to 84 months, while terms for a speciality vehicle are 36 to 84 months. Best for: Faster bank approvals. U.S. Bank truck loans are part of the banks equipment financing program, which is common among lenders. Loans can be up to $500,000. But theres also a faster process for funding up to $150,000, making U.S. Bank a good choice for companies that want to work with a bank, but avoid the usual paperwork that comes with it. You can get preapproved for up to $500,000, if youve yet to find the specific truck you need to finance and want to shop with financing in place. Terms range from 24 to over 60 months. Best for: Low-cost truck loans. Bank of America offers semi truck financing with its equipment loan program starting at anannual percentage rate of 3%. Youll need at least two years in business and $250,000 in annual revenue to qualify. Loans range from $25,000 to $750,000, with terms lasting up to 60 months. Vehicles must weigh more than 2.5 tons. Bank of America offers a business auto loan for lighter trucks. Alternative online lenders also offer commercial truck financing, and if your finances are strong, their rates may be comparable to banks. The added benefit of alternative lenders is fast funding. If you need to purchase or fix a semi truck in a hurry, look at these options. Best for: Same-day funding. Balboa Capital is an alternative lender that offers same-day funding for semi truck loans up to $250,000. Box trucks, refrigerator trucks and other light- and heavy-duty vehicles are eligible. You must be in business for at least a year with a minimum annual revenue of $100,000 to qualify. Balboa Capital says a "decent" FICO credit score is required, but doesn't specify a number. A score above 630 may be a good target, as that range can be considered "fair," though Balboa also says it considers all scores. Best for: Startup trucking companies. First Capital offers multiple commercial and semi truck financing and leasing programs many of which have flexible requirements. For example, funding is available if your company is a startup or doesnt have a commercial drivers license. First Capital also offers loans if your credit score is as low as 540, but with more mileage and vehicle restrictions than its other options. If youre able to make a down payment of at least 10%, you can get financing with no minimum credit score. If you want to work with a company with deep expertise in the trucking business, these direct lenders offer decades of experience. They may be more flexible compared with other financial institutions because they lend their own money. But compare rates to make sure you're getting the best deal. Best for: Borrowers with challenging credit histories. CAG Truck Capital has offered truck loans for over 30 years, financing all types of commercial trucks, including sleepers and private sales. It also offers engine overhaul financing, if your current big rig is in need of major work. CAG says it specializes in lending to borrowers with bad credit, including those with previous bankruptcies or current tax liens. Annual percentage rates start at 10%. Best for: No personal guarantee. Commercial Fleet Financing has been in business for 25 years, offering financing for semi trucks, trailers and other light- and heavy-duty vehicles. CFF says it can make credit decisions within two hours and fund within 24, offering a quick turnaround if you need funding fast. Depending on your time in business, CFF doesn't require a personal guarantee as business collateral, protecting your personal assets if your trucking company is unable to repay the debt. Best for: Borrowers with fair credit. Truck Lenders USA has been in business since 1977 and offers financing for all types of trucks that are less than 7 years old. Loans start at $15,000. Truck Lenders USA says it can approve applications within hours, but it has tougher requirements than some other direct lenders. For example, youll need a minimum credit score of 675 and at least two years in business to qualify. Determine your down payment. Knowing how much you can afford is a good start when buying any vehicle. Its especially important for a semi truck that could cost six figures even if you buy used. For example, if a lender requires a 20% down payment on a $100,000 big rig, you would need $20,000 on hand plus money for taxes, registration and other fees. Some lenders may offer no-money-down options, but youll need good credit to be eligible and will pay more overall by financing the entire purchase. Find the truck you want and lenders that will fund it. Your business will determine the vehicle you need, whether thats a box truck for a delivery company or an excavator for a construction firm. That choice will have a direct impact on financing options. For example, some lenders may have vehicle age or mileage requirements. Others may not finance sleeper cab trucks or private party purchases. Do you need multiple trucks? A lenders maximum funding amount may limit your options. Compare loans. You can use multiple types of business loans to finance a semi truck including those not specifically designed for big rigs. For example, a business line of credit could provide you with fast cash to fix up a truck. But opting for a commercial truck loan wont tie up working capital you need for other business costs, like paying drivers. Plus, the vehicle itself offers built-in collateral for lenders, so it may be easier to qualify for semi truck financing than other options. Gather paperwork and apply. Commercial truck lenders will have different application processes and requirements. Be prepared with details about your company (annual revenue, type of business), the vehicle you want to finance (type of truck, its mileage and age, the seller) and yourself (credit score, whether you have a commercial drivers license, or CDL, and for how long). Shop around, even if youre in a rush. Online and direct lenders can offer fast approvals so you have time to compare annual percentage rates. If you have bad credit, you may still be able to finance a semi truck with an alternative or direct lender. Because the truck itself serves as collateral, these lenders may be more open to approving borrowers with poor credit histories, past delinquencies or bankruptcies. But keep in mind that the lender will own the title on your truck and could repossess it if you dont pay. Make sure youll be able to afford the payments on your new loan and all the other costs that will come with the truck, like fuel, maintenance, tires and insurance. Like other bad credit business loans, commercial truck financing will likely be more expensive. You may be able to opt for a longer loan term to help manage costs or seasonal payment plans that can fit into your cash flow. If youre in the market for a semi truck, financing is often a better option than leasing. Big rigs may cover a million miles before they require serious work. That means theyre likely to remain productive long past a five- or seven-year loan repayment term. Still, commercial truck leasing can make sense in the following instances: Youre a startup. Failure isnt uncommon among trucking businesses and small operations, which make up most of the nation's carriers and were hit hard by pandemic shutdowns last year. That may make qualifying for a commercial truck loan even more difficult if your business lacks a track record. But you also may want to make sure your company can succeed before sinking a lot of equity into a truck via a hefty down payment or high monthly bills. You need to free up cash. A commercial truck loan may take up a good chunk of your working capital, while leasing can open up funding to funnel elsewhere. Leases typically come with lower upfront costs you may even be able to spread the sales tax over the leases term, depending on where you live and smaller monthly payments. Youre worried about longevity. Long-haulers have long shelf lives. But vehicles like delivery vans may face more wear and tear driving in congested city traffic or from starting and stopping often. Similarly, specialty trucks with complex parts may need more frequent repairs, or if your trucks are consumer-facing, you may want consistently new models to make a good impression.

<TITLE>Grant Systems    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The following systems and tools are involved in the registration, application, and reporting processes connected to federal awards. (Note: This is not an exhaustive list. Please email support@grants.gov to request that another federal system or tool be added.) ASAP, or the Automated Standard Application for Payments, is a platform through which award recipients and federal agencies may process grant payment requests and handle disbursement reporting activities. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CAGE Code website provides a standalone solution to search for foreign and domestic entities' CAGE information. DisasterAssistance.gov is a resource for citizens impacted by a disaster. The website provides information about support and services, and it is also a channel through which entities may apply for financial assistance. The Dun & Bradstreet Government iUpdate tool allows applicants to look-up or request a unique DUNS number, which is required when registering on Grants.gov. The National Institute of Health's (NIH) electronic Research Administration systems support grant processing for applicants, award recipients, and federal staff. The Federal Procurement Data System is a searchable repository of data related to government procurement and contracts. Some federal agencies also publish financial assistance data to the system. The grants management solutions developed by The Grants Center of Excellence (COE) serve both grant-making agencies as well as applicants and award recipients. Interagency Edison is a portal through which grant recipients and contractors report to their funding agency about inventions created with government funds. The Internet Data Entry System is the channel through which federal award recipients submit their single audit reporting packages to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. The CAGE Code is assigned to organizations (e.g., manufacturers, distributors, etc.) to facilitate the supply chain. The NATO Codification System (NCS) differentiates between the U.S. and NATO systems, so CAGE was referred to as NCAGE in the NCS community. The Payment Management System, like ASAP, is a platform that handles the grant payment requests and disbursement reporting activities of grant recipients and grant-making agencies. Research.gov serves the research community by providing access to important information, thus streamlining business processes among partner agencies. The System for Awards Management is a free platform through which entities applying to receive awards from the U.S. Federal Government must register. The Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System warehouses over 20 years of HHS grant-award program data, and it is designed to facilitate the public and private sector constituent's understanding of the work, availability, benefits, and trends in HHS-facilitated public investment. USASpending.gov is a single, searchable website accessible to the public listing information about every Federal award, as required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) of 2006.

<TITLE>Grantor Standard Language    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Grants.gov Program Management Office (PMO) has provided the following language for grantors preparing funding opportunity notices and application packages. Please use this language when creating a customized message for your internal or external communications about Grants.gov.  This section provides the application submission and receipt instructions for [INSERT AGENCY NAME] program applications. Please read the following instructions carefully and completely. 1. Electronic Delivery [INSERT AGENCY NAME] is participating in the Grants.gov initiative to provide the grant community with a single site to find and apply for grant funding opportunities. [INSERT AGENCY NAME] encourages applicants to submit their applications online through Grants.gov. 2. How to Register to Apply through Grants.gov a.Instructions: Read the instructions below about registering to apply for [INSERT AGENCY NAME] funds. Applicants should read the registration instructions carefully and prepare the information requested before beginning the registration process. Reviewing and assembling the required information before beginning the registration process will alleviate last-minute searches for required information. Organizations must have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, active System for Award Management (SAM) registration, and Grants.gov account to apply for grants. If individual applicants are eligible to apply for this funding opportunity, then you may begin with step 3, Create a Grants.gov Account, listed below. Creating a Grants.gov account can be completed online in minutes, but DUNS and SAM registrations may take several weeks. Therefore, an organization's registration should be done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact the entity's ability to meet required application submission deadlines. Complete organization instructions can be found on Grants.gov here: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration.html 1)Obtain a DUNS Number: All entities applying for funding, including renewal funding, must have a DUNS Number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). Applicants must enter the DUNS Number in the data entry field labeled "Organizational DUNS" on the SF-424 form. For more detailed instructions for obtaining a DUNS Number, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration/step-1-obtain-duns-number.html 2)Register with SAM: All organizations applying online through Grants.gov must register with the System for Award Management (SAM). Failure to register with SAM will prevent your organization from applying through Grants.gov. SAM registration must be renewed annually. For more detailed instructions for registering with SAM, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration/step-2-register-with-sam.html 3)Create a Grants.gov Account: The next step is to register an account with Grants.gov. Follow the on-screen instructions or refer to the detailed instructions here: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration.html 4) Add a Profile to a Grants.gov Account: A profile in Grants.gov corresponds to a single applicant organization the user represents (i.e., an applicant) or an individual applicant. If you work for or consult with multiple organizations and have a profile for each, you may log in to one Grants.gov account to access all of your grant applications. To add an organizational profile to your Grants.gov account, enter the DUNS Number for the organization in the UEI (Unique Entity Identifier) field while adding a profile. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/add-profile.html 5) EBiz POC Authorized Profile Roles: After you register with Grants.gov and create an Organization Applicant Profile, the organization applicant's request for Grants.gov roles and access is sent to the EBiz POC. The EBiz POC will then log in to Grants.gov and authorize the appropriate roles, which may include the AOR role, thereby giving you permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of the organization. You will be able to submit your application online any time after you have been assigned the AOR role. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/authorize-roles.html 6)Track Role Status: To track your role request, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track-role-status.html b.Electronic Signature: When applications are submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the organization applicant with the AOR role that submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The EBiz POC must authorize people who are able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as a user with the AOR role; this step is often missed and it is crucial for valid and timely submissions. 3. How to Submit an Application to [INSERT AGENCY NAME] via Grants.gov Grants.gov applicants can apply online using Workspace. Workspace is a shared, online environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different webforms within an application. For each funding opportunity announcement (FOA), you can create individual instances of a workspace. Below is an overview of applying on Grants.gov. For access to complete instructions on how to apply for opportunities, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/workspace-overview.html 1) Create a Workspace: Creating a workspace allows you to complete it online and route it through your organization for review before submitting. 2) Complete a Workspace: Add participants to the workspace to work on the application together, complete all the required forms online or by downloading PDF versions, and check for errors before submission. The Workspace progress bar will display the state of your application process as you apply. As you apply using Workspace, you may click the blue question mark icon near the upper-right corner of each page to access context-sensitive help. a.Adobe Reader: If you decide not to apply by filling out webforms you can download individual PDF forms in Workspace. The individual PDF forms can be downloaded and saved to your local device storage, network drive(s), or external drives, then accessed through Adobe Reader. NOTE: Visit the Adobe Software Compatibility page on Grants.gov to download the appropriate version of the software at: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/adobe-software-compatibility.html b.Mandatory Fields in Forms:In the forms, you will note fields marked with an asterisk and a different background color. These fields are mandatory fields that must be completed to successfully submit your application. c.Complete SF-424 Fields First: The forms are designed to fill in common required fields across other forms, such as the applicant name, address, and DUNS Number. Once it is completed, the information will transfer to the other forms. 3) Submit a Workspace: An application may be submitted through workspace by clicking the Sign and Submit button on the Manage Workspace page, under the Forms tab. Grants.gov recommends submitting your application package at least 24-48 hours prior to the close date to provide you with time to correct any potential technical issues that may disrupt the application submission. 4) Track a Workspace Submission: After successfully submitting a workspace application, a Grants.gov Tracking Number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) is automatically assigned to the application. The number will be listed on the Confirmation page that is generated after submission. Using the tracking number, access the Track My Application page under the Applicants tab or the Details tab in the submitted workspace. For additional training resources, including video tutorials, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/applicant-training.html Applicant Support: Grants.gov provides applicants 24/7 support via the toll-free number 1-800-518-4726 and email at support@grants.gov. For questions related to the specific grant opportunity, contact the number listed in the application package of the grant you are applying for. If you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the Grants.gov Support Center and get a ticket number. The Support Center ticket number will assist the [INSERT AGENCY NAME] with tracking your issue and understanding background information on the issue. 4. Timely Receipt Requirements and Proof of Timely Submission a. Online Submission.All applications must be received by [INSERT TIME] Eastern time on the due date established for each program. Proof of timely submission is automatically recorded by Grants.gov. An electronic date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by Grants.gov. The applicant with the AOR role who submitted the application will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and a tracking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) from Grants.gov with the successful transmission of their application. This applicant with the AOR role will also receive the official date/time stamp and Grants.gov Tracking number in an email serving as proof of their timely submission. When [INSERT AGENCY NAME] successfully retrieves the application from Grants.gov, and acknowledges the download of submissions, Grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the application to the email address of the applicant with the AOR role who submitted the application. Again, proof of timely submission shall be the official date and time that Grants.gov receives your application. Applications received by Grants.gov after the established due date for the program will be considered late and will not be considered for funding by [INSERT AGENCY NAME]. Applicants using slow internet, such as dial-up connections, should be aware that transmission can take some time before Grants.gov receives your application. Again, Grants.gov will provide either an error or a successfully received transmission in the form of an email sent to the applicant with the AOR role attempting to submit the application. The Grants.gov Support Center reports that some applicants end the transmission because they think that nothing is occurring during the transmission process. Please be patient and give the system time to process the application.

<TITLE>“What Is a Grant?” – Grants.gov Community Blog</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Grants.gov Community Blog Connecting the grant community to #LearnGrants Editors Note: This blog post was first published in 2017 and updated on August 18, 2020. A Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is the document all federal agencies use to announce the availability of grant funds to the public.  Continue reading What Is a Funding Opportunity Announcement(FOA)? Note: This blog post was originally published in 2017 and updated on March 18, 2020. To understand the definitions of subaward and subrecipient, it helps to think in terms of a grant that has just been won. (If you are not sure what an award is, start with the What Is an Award? post, then come back.)  Rather than the grantor (i.e., the grant-making agency) entrusting just one entity with carrying out a federal program, sometimes multiple awardees will shoulder the responsibilities. In such cases, one entity the one who submitted the grant application will serve as a pass-through to the partnering entities, which are called subrecipients. Continue reading What Is a Subaward and aSubrecipient? This post is part of our What Is? explainer series, which also covers topics like block grants and budget narratives. The Unique Entity Identifier, or the UEI, is the official name of the new, non-proprietary identifier that will replace the D-U-N-S number, according to the General Services Administration (GSA). The UEI will be requested in, and assigned by, the System for Award Management (SAM.gov).  Continue reading What is the Unique Entity Identifier(UEI)? Note: This blog post was originally published in 2017 and updated on January 21, 2020. A block grant is a specific type of federal financial assistance for a broadly defined function. (Editors note: Before getting into the nuance of block grants, you may want to review the terms federal financial assistance and grant.) Block grants are often awarded by the federal government to U.S. state or territory governments, although some block grants are awarded directly to local governments (e.g., Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement Program to cities and counties on a formula basis). The block grant recipients then implement the programs within those broadly defined functions (i.e., the purpose & parameters defined by legislation).   Continue reading What Is a Block Grant?[Updated] This post was originally published in 2017 and updated on January 2, 2020. When you hear the word award, do you envision the federal government conferring funding to you to implement a public-serving project? Some of you grant professionals did, but it is understandable if you thought of this years Best Film, the league MVP debate, or your childs T-ball participation trophy.   Continue reading What Is a FederalAward? This post was originally published in 2016 and updated on January 15, 2020. A land grant is an award of land to a recipient with the requirement that a public purpose, as defined by legislation, is served through the grant. In Part 1, we covered land grant colleges and universities, which are great examples of land grants achieving lasting benefits in the United States of America.   The passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 established a land grant program that allowed individuals, both U.S. citizens and intended citizens, to apply for 160-acre plots of land. Homesteading was a term referring to the process of moving west onto land in unsettled territories and cultivating the land. Continue reading What Is a Land Grant? (Part 2): Grants to Individuals for Homesteading andSettlement This post was originally published in 2016 and updated on November 19, 2019. Land grant is a term you may have heard before, especially if you grew up near a state college or university that received land or funding as a result of one of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts. Before we begin our grant history lesson, lets define what a land grant is.  A grant is the transfer of anything of value from the Federal government to a non-federal entity to carry out a public purpose authorized by U.S. law. So, a land grant is an award of land, instead of money, to a recipient with the requirement that a public purpose, as defined by legislation, is served through the grant. Continue reading What Is a Land Grant? (Part 1): Land Grant Colleges andUniversities The What is Blog Series is designed to serve as an entry point for readers who are new to federal grants, or who might just need a refresher. Click here to read more posts in this series.  A budget narrative provides explanations about line items from the grant applicants standard budget. In federal grant applications, a budget narrative is sometimes called a budget justification or a budget detail. Continue reading What Is a BudgetNarrative? This post was originally published on December 6, 2016 and updated on October 7, 2019. Within the realm of federal government grants, research and development grants are some of the most numerous and diverse. What types of research grants does the Federal government support? When you search for research on Grants.gov, there are currently over 1,600 open grant opportunities!Each of these diverse assistance programs and grant opportunities are legislatively authorized federal assistance programs that federal grant-making agencies use to support research.  A simple definition of research is the careful study that is done to find and report new knowledge about something (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). While many of us may picture scientists in white coats performing lab experiments, the range of research grants is far wider. Continue reading What Is a ResearchGrant? The What is Blog Series is designed to serve as a gentle entry point for readers who are new to federal grants, or who might just need a refresher on a particular term. Previous installments have focused mainly on defining types of federal funding. Here, and in several forthcoming series posts, we will explore terminology within the federal grant application itself, beginning with something that is sometimes called the heart of the federal grant proposal the statement of need, or need(s) statement.  A need statement outlines a public or community need that the federal grant applicants proposed project aims to address. The need statement may be a few sentences, or a few paragraphs, in length. It is typically one part a very important part of the larger project narrative that carries the reader from the defined need into discussion of specifically how the applicant aims to address that need. The need statement should tell a story that conveys the applicants knowledge and insight, and demonstrate that the organization understands the issue well enough to address the problem, reads guidance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In the context of federal grants, the problem can be anything from the need to digitize and preserve historically significant photographs to the need to protect a habitat or an endangered species, or the need to investigate a scientific finding that promises health benefits for people with cancer, or the need to support efforts to re-train workers from fading industries. The need statement, then, conveys that the applicant is both familiar and equipped to address a problem according to the specifics outlined in the federal agencys funding opportunity announcement published on Grants.gov. We have devoted a separate blog post focused on how to write a good need statement. Some federal agencies also publish successful proposals on their website. Dig into these and you will find some great examples of need statements. We recommend starting with the Institute of Museum and Library Services application database.

From user guides to FAQs and pro tips, the following resources will help you master Grants.gov as a grantor: This video explains how federal grant-making agencies can affiliate (as part of the agency) newly registered Grants.gov users. Click here to learn more about grantor registration. The following practices will help to ensure that your agency's application submission process runs as smoothly as possible: A primary reason application submissions are rejected is that the person submitting the application has not completed the Grants.gov registration process. It is recommended that grantors provide applicants with an overview of the process in the announcement instructions. For customizable copy about the registration process, please see "Standard Language Describing the Grants.gov Application Process."  When indicating the Expected Number of Applications, agencies should strive to be as accurate as possible.  Some agencies are incorrectly inserting "Grants.gov Help Desk" as the Agency Contact when posting an announcement. The intent of these fields is to connect the applicant to someone within your program office who can assist them when they have questions about your specific announcement. Here is how the following fields should be used:  Find registration, login, and search instructions for all users in the Grants.gov Online User Guide.  For detailed grantor information, review the Grantors section of the online user guide.  Please contact yourGrants.gov Program Advisor. These Program Advisors are assigned to specific federal agencies and are available to help answer your questions about getting started on Grants.gov.  Including language about the Grants.gov applicant registration process when posting announcements decreases the likelihood of rejected applications due to registration or AOR role assignment issues. The Agency Contact should be someone within your program who can respond to email queries about the specific award announcement.

<TEXT>
The following answers address common queries relating to managing agencies and users, creating application packages and templates, and more. Please refer to the Grants.gov Online User Guide for a complete description and discussion of the Grants.gov Grantor system.  How many grantors can register under an agency? An unlimited number of grantors can be registered under an agency. Read the Grantor Registration page for more information. How can a user affiliate their Grants.gov account with an agency? Complete the Grantor Registration process, then contact your agency point of contact (POC) for Grants.gov. Read the Grantors: Add Profile & Agency Affiliation help article for more information. What roles can be assigned to agency users? When a user has registered with Grants.gov, they have the ability to log in, but they cannot perform agency-related actions until they are given a role. Read the Manage Roles help article for a list of roles and functionality associated with each. Grants.gov will perform the initial set-up of the agency. From there, the Agency Administrator will be able to set up sub-agencies. Contact your Grants.gov Program Advisor to have your agency registered. top   How is a sub-agency created on Grants.gov? Grantors with the Manage Agencies role are able to create agencies and sub-agencies in Grants.gov. Review the Create Agency help article and Modify Agency and Sub-Agency help article for instructions. How does a user become a sub-agency administrator? Grantors with the Manage Grantors role may assign roles to grantors within their agency and sub-agencies. For new users, please Register with Grants.gov then follow the Add Profile & Agency Affiliation instructions. For information on how to add roles to a grantor, review the Manage Roles help article. top   I have already downloaded and acknowledged all of my submitted application packages. When will these old submitted applications be removed? Submitted applications will be available on the "View All Submitted Applications" page for 5 years* after submission. *Note: The application purge period was increased from 180 days to 5 years on October 20, 2015, so all applications submitted on or after April 22, 2015 will be stored for 5 years. All applications submitted before April 22, 2015 have been deleted under the previous 180 day purge period. I downloaded my applications days ago, so why won't they disappear from the Retrieve Submitted Applications list? If you have downloaded an application and it is still visible in the list, you may have forgotten to click the Acknowledge Completion of Download button. After downloading applications, clicking on the Acknowledge Completion of Download button will change the status of the applications. The status is viewable both to the Grantor and to the applicant communities. top   I just assigned an agency tracking number to an application. When I clicked on the Continue button, the application was no longer on the screen. What happened to it? Users still have access to these submissions after assigning the agency tracking number; search criteria can be adjusted to view those submissions. The Assign Tracking Numbers screen only displays applications submitted to your agency that have not yet been assigned a tracking number. You may see a full list of applications submitted to your agency by clicking the View All Submitted Applications link. How does my applicant know an agency tracking number has been assigned to his/her application? The applicant will receive an email notification stating that a tracking number has been assigned. An applicant may also obtain the tracking number for their grant application by logging on and checking the status of their grant application. What if my agency does not assign tracking numbers? Assigning tracking numbers is not mandatory and is the choice of the individual agency. If your agency does not assign tracking numbers, the application process will not be affected. top   What information will I need to publish an opportunity? Please review the Manage Opportunities help article and Create Grant Opportunities help article for information about publishing funding opportunity announcements and the required information. Can I post earmarked or mandatory grant application packages on Grants.gov? Yes. You can post any type of application package on Grants.gov. In the case of those packages that have a limited applicant pool or that are part of a block or mandatory grant program, you can simply post the application package on Grants.gov without publishing an opportunity synopsis. The applicant will be able to find the package on the Search for Opportunity Package page. How can I create a draft of a grant synopsis or forecast for my co-workers to review? When creating a grant synopsis or forecast of a funding opportunity announcement, it is considered a draft until it reaches the Post Date you selected and is published by the system. Your co-workers, or anyone with the appropriate Grantor roles, may review and edit it until its publication. Some Grantors may choose to set the Post Date well into the future to give ample time to create, refine, and finalize the grant synopsis or forecast. Once the synopsis or forecast is ready for publication, the Grantor may change the Post Date to make the opportunity available to the public. Will I be able to make any modifications to application packages after they are published? Yes, you can modify an application package at any time. However, please keep in mind that if you make any significant changes to an existing application package, applicants must update their application and possibly lose work already completed. For applicants using Grants.gov Workspace, they will see an alert on the Manage Workspace page to update their application. Applicants who have signed up for email notifications will be automatically notified of the changes via email, if the grantor chooses to send change notifications. How do you create a template? Users with the Agency Template Creator role may create and manage application package templates. Read the Manage Application Package Templates help article and Create Application Package Templates for instructions on using the template functionality. Why am I getting an error message that says Grants.gov does not recognize my agency's CFDA Number? Grants.gov uses a nightly extract from the CFDA Catalog to update its information. If the CFDA has not updated its catalog yet, Grants.gov may not have the information necessary to recognize the CFDA Program Number. If you are the agency administrator, please contact your Grants.gov agency Program Advisor. Grants.gov may be able to manually insert this information. If you are not the Agency Administrator, work with that designated person in your agency to resolve the issue. top   How do I create a form? Before a grant application form can appear in a Grants.gov user's workspace, it must be approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and developed by Grants.gov's team of developers and testers. Read the Forms Request for information on how to have a form added to Grants.gov. Will Grants.gov obtain OMB approval for me? No. Agencies are responsible for obtaining OMB approval prior to submitting the forms to Grants.gov for development. OMB approval is not needed if the agency uses forms that lists Grants.gov as the Agency Owner because these forms have been approved for government-wide use. Review the Forms Process page for more information. How can I view the forms that Grants.gov has created? Grants.gov has all of the forms listed on the website within the Forms Repository. Review the Forms Request page for more information. Is it possible to reuse an existing form? Yes. The following four types of forms are currently available for your use: May I reuse an existing form but add my agency's name to it? Yes. Just let Grants.gov know when you submit your forms request for development. My agency requires that all applications be signed. Does Grants.gov handle electronic signatures, and has the signature undergone legal review? Grants.gov does provide electronic signatures on forms that contain a signature block (e.g., SF424, Certifications, and Assurances). However, you should continue to adhere to the policies set forth by your agency regarding electronic signatures for grant applications. What file formats are supported for applicants uploading files? Currently, when using the standard attachment forms provided by Grants.gov, there are no restrictions on file types. If you would like to restrict your applicants to certain formats (e.g., Word, Excel, PDF), please specify the particular formats within your agency-specific instructions.       Grantors may register and log on to Grants.gov, but they will not be able to perform agency-related actions until they are assigned a role.                                                                          Forms can take up to three or four months to develop. It's important to allow for this development time in your planning processes. What should I do if I receive the message "Email Already Exists in System" and I am unable to register? If you receive the message "Email Already Exists in System," your email address has already been used to register. Go to the Login page and use the Forgot My Username function to retrieve the username associated with your email address. What is a profile? A profile in Grants.gov corresponds to a single applicant organization the user represents (i.e., an applicant), an individual applicant, or a single federal agency (i.e., for grantors). Read the Add Profile and Agency Affiliation help article for instructions on how to register with Grants.gov and have your profile affiliated with an agency. What are the Grants.gov password requirements? top  How do I use my PIV/CAC card to login to Grants.gov? First, you must have a Grants.gov account with a Grantor profile. Then you need to link your PIV/CAC card to your Grants.gov account. Read the Link to Grants.gov Account (PIV/CAC) help article for instructions and additional troubleshooting information. What federal agencies are supported on the Grants.gov PIV/CAC login screen? The PIV/CAC cards for the following federal agencies are supported: To request that your agency's PIV/CAC card be supported by Grants.gov, or if you are unable to link your agency's PIV/CAC card to your Grants.gov account, please contact your agency's assigned Grants.gov Program Advisor for assistance. Why am I being locked out from logging in? For your security, Grants.gov sets a system lockout on your account if it recognizes actions that appear to be a remote attempt to hack into your account. After three (3) consecutive failed attempts at login over a period of 5 minutes, accounts are locked for 15 minutes. How do I log in after being locked out? If you have a username and password, wait 15 minutes before taking any action on the login page. After 15 minutes, your correct username and password will allow you to log in. If you do not want to wait 15 minutes to unlock your account, click "Forgot My Password/Unlock My Account". How do I retrieve a forgotten username? To retrieve the username associated with your email address: I forgot my password. How do I reset my password? To reset the password associated with your account: top  How long are passwords valid? Passwords are valid for 60 days and will not be valid on the 61st day onward. How do I log in after my password expires? If you always login to Grants.gov using an alternate method (Login.gov, PIV/CAC card, etc.), you may disregard password expiration notices. At any point when you attempt to log into Grants.gov with your expired password, you will be prompted to reset the expired password. To reset an expired password: top  Why has my Grants.gov account been deactivated? Your Grants.gov account is automatically deactivated after 365 days of inactivity (i.e., not logging in for a year). Grants.gov automatically sends you four separate warning emails, one per week for the four weeks immediately preceding your deactivation. If your account is deactivated, you will lose all roles in Grants.gov. What do I do after my Grants.gov account is deactivated for inactivity? If your account is deactivated, you must log in and change your password to re-activate your account. If you do not remember your password, then click the Forgot My Password/Unlock My Account link and follow the on-screen instructions. The next steps depend on your account type: top  Which web browsers are supported by Grants.gov? The latest versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari are supported for use with Grants.gov. However, these web browsers undergo frequent changes and updates, so we recommend you have the latest version when using Grants.gov. Legacy versions of these web browsers may be functional, but you may experience issues. Grants.gov no longer provides support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 or below. Which security protocols does my web browser need to support to access Grants.gov? Your web browser must support at least one of the following: Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2. Note: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are disabled in the Training environment and will be disabled in the Production environment in the future. Read the Grants.gov Notices page for more information. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2 and 3 are not supported. How do I clear my browser cache? The cache refers to the Temporary Internet Files folder which contains a record of the items you have seen, heard, or downloaded from the web, including images, sounds and web pages.

<TITLE>Grant Reporting    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
In 2006, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) set in motion a government-wide reporting procedure that has continued to evolve. The law requires that information about entities and organizations receiving federal funds be disclosed to the public via a central website, USAspending.gov. This information currently includes the entity's name, amount of the grant, funding agency, and location among other requirements and is published by the grant-making agency on USASpending.gov. The federal award recipient called the "prime awardee" by FFATA files progress reports via the FFATA Sub-award Reporting System (FSRS). Sub-recipients those entities receiving sub-grants submit data to the prime awardee. (Those sub-recipients with awards of $25,000 or more must have their data shared by the prime awardee through FSRS.) The following chart lays out this process in a linear format: Sub-awardees give their reporting data to prime awardees; prime awardees submit all required data via FSRS; and federal grant-making agencies publish program data on USASpending.gov. Sub-awardees give their reporting data to prime awardees. Prime awardees submit all required data via FSRS. Federal grant-making agencies publish program data on USASpending.gov. What kinds of data are federal award recipients expected to include in their reporting? The information falls into one of three categories: financial data, such as expenses paid for with federal funds; compliance information to ensure the recipient is following federal regulations; and project data highlighting progress and/or community impact. Grant-making agencies use this information, in part, to gauge the success of their own programs and initiatives. The required information may be collected through several different channels, including regular progress reports, site visits, and audits (see table below). Grant recipients submit regular reports (called "Performance Progress Reports" or "Research Performance Progress Reports") documenting a project throughout its lifespan. These reports may include both expense-related data and quantitative information about the project's impact.
