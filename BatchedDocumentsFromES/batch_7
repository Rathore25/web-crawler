<TITLE>Submitting UTF-8 Special Characters    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Grants.gov is configured to receive and transfer all UTF-8 characters, which includes those characters commonly referred to as "special characters." Examples of special characters include the tilde (~), letters with accent marks (), and Greek letters (). Grants.gov will receive and transfer all UTF-8 characters as they are entered into Grants.gov via: (1) PDF and S2S submissions (2) User interface (UI) entry (3) System-to-system (S2S) connection  Why does this matter for Applicants? Applicants are able to enter all special characters from the UTF-8 character set when submitting applications and information to Grants.gov. However, if the grantor's system is not yet compatible with these special characters, the grantor system may produce garbled or missing text in the application. As a result, the application may be rejected. Applicants should also identify whether the system they use to apply to Grants.gov is compatible with special characters in the UTF-8 character set. If the applicant system is not compatible, but the applicant still enters special characters, then Grants.gov may receive garbled or missing data which will be transferred to the grantor. Applicant Actions:  Read all the instructions provided by the grantor, which may include instructions not to use certain special characters. Check your grant application systems for compatibility with special characters in the UTF-8 character set, if applicable.  Why does this matter for Grantors? Grants.gov will transfer the special characters in an application exactly as received. However, if the grantor's systems, including S2S, are not compatible with the entire UTF-8 character set, then the grantor systems will not be able to read the special characters. The result may be garbled or missing data in applications. Grantor Actions:  Upgrade your system to accept special characters in the UTF-8 character set. Include instructions to applicants which special characters cannot be submitted in applications. Special Character Impact Summary Table Applicant UTF-8 Compatibility Grantor UTF-8 Compatibility Applicant Impact Grantor Impact PDF Applicant using UTF-8 Compatible Package  Applicant S2S with applicant system not UTF-8 Compatible Applicant S2S with applicant system UTF-8 Compatible   Review the application instructions provided by the award-making agency for their attachment restrictions. You should also review the instructions on the form you are completing. If there are no restrictions for file names identified by the agency or in the form, then the file name restrictions are as follows: We are seeing issues (i.e. "java.lang.Exception: 16 errors") when submissions are not following the filename restrictions. Below are two examples where the system returned "error 16" when an applicant used an incorrect filename: EXAMPLE 1 [2009-02-11 11:17:46,610][FATAL][GrantS2SFacade.submitApplication()1377]-Couldn't completely receive Submission due to unknown Exception.

<TITLE>Grant Policies    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Billions of dollars in Federal grants are awarded each year for programs and projects that benefit the public. This assistance is rooted in the Constitution and its call to "promote the general Welfare." It wasn't until the 1970's, however, that Federal grant policy began to evolve into what it is today. In the 70's, Congressional lawmakers responded to reports that Federal agencies were using assistance awards, or grants, to pay for services. In doing so, they could side-step competition and procurement rules normally associated with government contracting. The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act, passed in 1977, set out to guide government agencies in their use of Federal funds particularly by defining the roles of contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants. Contracts, the law states, should be awarded when a Federal agency is acquiring something an improved computer network, for example. Grants and cooperative agreements, meanwhile, should be awarded when a Federal agency is providing assistance, such as funding for a lower-income housing program in an at-risk urban community. To help with the implementation of the law, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published guidance in 1978 directing agencies to ensure that grants funds be used only for assistance-based programs and projects.  Since the 1970's, subsequent grant-related legislation has helped to further develop Federal grant policy. It works much like it did in 1977 and 1978: Congress creates the grant-related laws and regulations. The Executive Office of the President of which OMB is part helps to implement the laws through Executive Orders and Guidance that define administrative rules. Finally, the grant-making agencies create internal and external policies and procedures based on the OMB guidance. (See chart.) These agency-specific policies for award recipients do not carry the weight of law, though they may be required of award recipients if they are listed in the Notice of Award.  When a new law is added to the books, that is only the beginning.  Other legislation has addressed everything from lobbying efforts to auditing requirements, to reporting procedures, to transparency and cross-agency data-sharing. The OMB along with other bodies has continued to play an important role in interpreting and implementing the laws among the Federal government's awarding agencies. Today's current grant policies have been largely shaped by a range of statutes, regulations, Executive Orders and guidance. To learn more about current grant policies, click below for summaries of the laws and their intended impact, beginning with the most recent: Review the Uniform Guidance page or check out the CFO training resources for the latest grants guidance.   Read about news and updates to federal grant policy on the Grants.gov Community Blog.

<TITLE>Grant Eligibility    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Determining whether you are eligible to apply for and receive a federal grant is very important. If you are not legally eligible for a specific funding opportunity, you would waste a lot of time and money completing the application process when you cannot actually receive the grant. When considering eligibility, the first step is to know what type of organization you represent (or whether you are applying as an individual). If you already know whether you will apply on behalf of your organization or as an individual, then you are ready to check your eligibility. There are many types of organizations generally eligible to apply for funding opportunities on Grants.gov. Each type of organization listed in the categories below is a specific search criterion in Search Grants. Individual applicants are welcome too! Small business grants may be awarded to companies meeting the size standards established by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for most industries in the economy. Individual people may submit applications for a funding opportunity on their own behalf (i.e., not on behalf of a company, organization, institution, or government). If you are registered with only an individual applicant profile, you are only allowed to apply to funding opportunities that are open to individuals. Most of the funding opportunities on Grants.gov are for organizations, not individuals. If you are looking for personal financial assistance or other types of funding, check out the Grant Programs section to learn about how to find other forms of funding from the government. The authorizing legislation and agency policies will determine whether a foreign individual or organization may apply for the grant. Foreign applicants need to complete the same registration process as domestic applicants, but there are additional steps to this registration process. Depending on the intended usage of the grant you are applying for, you may need to file a U.S. tax return which requires a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), also referred to as an employer Identification Number (EIN). If a non-resident alien is awarded funding to perform activities outside the United States, then this likely does not constitute U.S. source income and a TIN/EIN is not necessary. Examples of such funding include scholarships, fellowship grants, targeted grants, and achievement awards. Before applying, foreign applicants should thoroughly review the IRS website and search for their most recent guidance for Aliens and International Taxpayers. Are you an individual or family looking for financial assistance? Visit the Benefits.gov site and find benefits, browse State programs, or learn about Federal programs. We have all seen them; late night infomercials, websites, and reference guides, advertising "millions in free money". Don't believe the hype! Although there are many funding opportunities on Grants.gov, few of them are available to individuals and none of them are available for personal financial assistance. To find an alphabetical listing of federal personal assistance visit the USA.gov website. Are you a business or organization offering goods or services for the use of the government? Visit Federal Business Opportunities at FBO.gov. Learn more about determining your eligibility for a federal grant by reading Grant Eligibility posts on the Grants.gov Community Blog .

<TITLE>Applicant FAQs    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
 What is a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)? A Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) is a unique number assigned to all entities (public and private companies, individuals, institutions, or organizations) who register to do business with the federal government. (U.S. General Services Administration) What is the difference between a "DUNS UEI" and a "SAM UEI" in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov)? "DUNS UEI" refers to your current 9-digit Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number issued by Dun and Bradstreet. "SAM UEI" refers to your new 12-character unique entity identifier that will be assigned by SAM.gov. Which UEI should I enter into the UEI field on the Grants.gov website and mobile app? Grants.gov encourages applicants to use their SAM UEI after they have been assigned one. Grants.gov also accepts applicants DUNS UEI, provided the DUNS UEI is available in SAM. Which UEI should I enter into application package forms? If the field label reads DUNS, enter your DUNS UEI. If the field label reads UEI, enter your SAM UEI. Where do I go to learn more about the UEI? The U.S. General Services Administration Unique Entity Identifier Update page contains the most up-to-date information about the UEI. top  Do I need to register with Grants.gov to apply using Workspace? Yes, you need one Grants.gov account. If you work with multiple organizations on grant applications, you can create and manage multiple profiles within the same Grants.gov account. For more information, read the My Account help article. How do I register as a consultant so I can support my clients in Workspace? Register an account on Grants.gov, then the applicant organization(s) can add you as a participant to their workspace. Who can create a workspace? Anyone with the Workspace Manager role can create a workspace. For more information, read the Workspace Roles page. Who can submit a workspace application? Is there a way to limit submission of the application to one user? Only users with the Standard Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) role who are added as a Workspace Participant may submit an application. If your organization uses the Expanded AOR role, then any user with the Expanded AOR role may submit any workspace, even if they are not added as a Workspace Participant. For more information, read the Workspace Roles page and the Manage Organization Profile help article. What happens if a form is not locked and two people try to fill out a webform or try to work on the same individual PDF form at the same time? When a Workspace Participant clicks the Webform link to start working on an online form, Grants.gov Workspace automatically locks the form to that user. A different Workspace Participant cannot fill out a webform at the same time. When two Workspace Participants work on an unlocked PDF form simultaneously, changes to form data will only be captured within the workspace once the PDF form is uploaded. So the last person to upload the form will overwrite the previous uploadWorkspace will prompt you before this happens. However, once a form is locked to a participant, any attempts to upload the form by another user will be blocked by the system. For more information, read the Fill Out Webforms, Lock Forms, Unlock Forms, Override Locked Forms help articles. Can I preview my application? Yes. Go to the View Application tab in Workspace to preview the application forms. Review the View Application Tab help article and Attachments Tab help article for more information. How long will my submitted application package be retained in the Grants.gov system? Submitted application packages will be retained for 5 years* after submission and status can be checked using the Track My Application page or the Check Application Status page after logging into Grants.gov. Submitted applications with "Validated", "Received By Agency", or "Agency Tracking Number Assigned" status will be available for download from the Check Application Status page during this time. Workspace submissions can be downloaded from the Details tab of the workspace. *Note: The application purge period was increased from 180 days to 5 years on October 20, 2015, so all applications submitted on or after April 22, 2015 will be stored for 5 years. All applications submitted before April 22, 2015 have been deleted under the previous 180 day purge period. How can I verify the contents of my submitted application package? After submitting the application package through Workspace, applicants should download a copy of the submitted application for offline record-keeping and to verify the contents of the submission zip file. We recommend downloading the submitted application via the Details tab of the workspace and verifying the contents of each file in the zip. Note: Applicants can download a zip file of applications only when the submitted application is in one of the following statuses: Validated, Received by Agency, or Agency Tracking Number Assigned. top  What is the attachment file size limit or maximum? Read the federal award-making agency's application instructions for the file size limit for each grant application package you submit. Grants.gov suggests limiting the file size of the entire grant application package including all the attachments to 200MB. Why does the federal agency say there are no attachments in my application when I can see attachments in the form? When completing a PDF form using Adobe software, it is important to only use the Add Attachments buttons in the form to attach a document. If you use other attachment functions, such as those built into Adobe Reader or the menu bar, this will cause errors in the submission and the attachments will not actually transmit to the federal agency.  What type of attachments may be added to an application form? Each agency has their own restrictions on the type of attachments (e.g., .pdf,.xls,.docx) and file sizes allowed for a particular grant opportunity application package. If you are adding a video (e.g., .mpeg,.mov), image (e.g., tif., jpg., .png), or audio (e.g., .wav, .aif, .au, etc.) be sure to compress these files for web usage. There are different types of applications and compression methods, so please be sure to check the agency instructions for guidance on quality, resolution, and bit rate standards they allow for submission. NOTE: Although Grants.gov does not restrict types of file attachments, if more than one attachment is included in a grant submission and two or more files have the same name, the grant application cannot be processed without manual intervention. To correct this, you should: Yes, but it can vary per agency and form in the application package. NOTE: If these guidelines are not followed, your application may be rejected. top  Can I copy and paste information into my Grants.gov application from a Microsoft Word document? Copying and pasting data into a Grants.gov application form from Word may lead to errors in the Adobe Reader form. If using the copy and paste function, copy the information from a text editor, such as Notepad or TextEdit, which does not have proprietary fonts or special characters. What kind of information can be entered into form fields within my application? Grants.gov application packages offer fields to enter a set amount of data. When the limit is reached for a certain field, you will no longer be able to enter data into that field. For every form, there are different limitations to the data that you are allowed to enter (this varies between agency and form). Refer to the agency instructions available for download with the application package for more detail. Grant.gov is now capable of accepting special characters (UTF-8 character set) within form fields; however, please refer to the specific agency instructions for guidance regarding the use of special characters. NOTE: If these guidelines are not followed, your application may be rejected. How can I find my congressional district code? To find your congressional district, go to House.gov and search for your Congressional District by entering your zip code + 4. If you do not know your zip code + 4, you may look it up by visiting USPS Look Up Zip Code page. The congressional district code should use the 2 character state abbreviation, a hyphen, and then a 3 character district number. For example, CA-005 for California's 5th district or VA-008 for Virginia's 8th district. Use 00-000 for programs or projects outside the US. top  Along with your contact information, please share the following supporting details, as applicable, to help the Grants.gov Support Center provide more efficient and effective assistance: top  Find registration, search, and application instructions for all users in the Grants.gov Online User Guide. For detailed applicant information, review the Applicants section of the online user guide. Contact the Grants.gov Support Center to get help from a representative. Email us at support@grants.gov or visit our Support page. What should I do if I receive the message "Email Already Exists in System" and I am unable to register? If you receive the message "Email Already Exists in System," your email address has already been used to register. Go to the Login page and use the Forgot My Username function to retrieve the username associated with your email address. What is a profile? A profile in Grants.gov corresponds to a single applicant organization the user represents (i.e., an applicant), an individual applicant, or a single federal agency (i.e., for grantors). If you work for or consult with multiple organizations and have a profile for each, you may log in to one Grants.gov account to access all of your workspaces. Read the Add Profile to a Grants.gov Account page. What are the Grants.gov password requirements? top  Why am I being locked out from logging in? For your security, Grants.gov sets a system lockout on your account if it recognizes actions that appear to be a remote attempt to hack into your account. After three (3) consecutive failed attempts at login over a period of 5 minutes, accounts are locked for 15 minutes. How do I log in after being locked out? If you have a username and password, wait 15 minutes before taking any action on the login page. After 15 minutes, your correct username and password will allow you to log in. If you do not want to wait 15 minutes to unlock your account, click "Forgot My Password/Unlock My Account". How do I retrieve a forgotten username? To retrieve the username associated with your email address: I forgot my password. How do I reset my password? To reset the password associated with your account: If you do not receive an email with a temporary code from Grants.gov, please call Grants.gov Support at 1-800-518-4726, or send an email to support@grants.gov. top  How long are passwords valid? Passwords are valid for 60 days and will not be valid on the 61st day onward. How do I log in after my password expires? If you always login to Grants.gov using an alternate method (such as Login.gov), you may disregard password expiration notices. At any point when you attempt to log into Grants.gov with your expired password, you will be prompted to reset the expired password. To reset an expired password: top  Why has my Grants.gov account been deactivated? Your Grants.gov account is automatically deactivated after 365 days of inactivity (i.e., not logging in for a year). Grants.gov automatically sends you four separate warning emails, one per week for the four weeks immediately preceding your deactivation. If your account is deactivated, you will lose all roles in Grants.gov. Roles are not applicable to EBiz POCs and individual applicant profiles, but their account will also be deactivated after inactivity for 365 days. What do I do after my Grants.gov account is deactivated for inactivity? If your account is deactivated, you must log in and change your password to re-activate your account. If you do not remember your password, then click the Forgot My Password/Unlock My Account link and follow the on-screen instructions. The next steps depend on your account type: top  Which web browsers are supported by Grants.gov? The latest versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari are supported for use with Grants.gov. However, these web browsers undergo frequent changes and updates, so we recommend you have the latest version when using Grants.gov. Legacy versions of these web browsers may be functional, but you may experience issues. Grants.gov no longer provides support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 or below. Which security protocols does my web browser need to support to access Grants.gov? Your web browser must support at least one of the following: Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2. Note: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are disabled in the Training environment and will be disabled in the Production environment in the future. Read the Grants.gov Notices page for more information. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2 and 3 are not supported. When using the Workspace online webforms in Safari, when I click on the View Attachments button nothing happens? The Safari browser blocks pop-up windows by default. You will need to allow pop-up windows in order to view attachments in Workspace online webforms. How to Disable a Pop-Up Blocker: Safari for Mac How do I clear my browser cache? The cache refers to the Temporary Internet Files folder which contains a record of the items you have seen, heard, or downloaded from the web, including images, sounds and web pages. Below are links to instructions on how to clear your browser cache: top  How can I prevent a virus from infecting my computer or system? Grants.gov checks for viruses when a file is uploaded, but it is the users' responsibility to make sure they do a virus check on their end when downloading to help protect against zero-day attacks. A zero-day attack is an attack on a computer system that exploits a previously unknownvulnerability that the vendor has not had time to address and patch.

<TITLE>Hashing    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Grants.gov requires the Applicant organizations to hash each submission attachment in order to ensure proper delivery of the submission to the agency. Note: As of June 16, 2018 with Release 16.2.1, the Submission Hash will no longer be validated for either submission header version (V1.0 and V2.0). There are no changes to the attachment hash processing. This section describes the Grants.gov technical requirements for Applicant S2S submissions. Grants.gov uses the SHA-1 for computing hash values. The resulting hash value shall be encoded using the Base64 data encoding specification (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3548.txt). The resulting value will be populated in the global schema HashValue element. As of June 16, 2018 with Release 16.2.1, Grants.gov no longer requires the Applicant organizations to hash the <grant:Forms> XML node for single-project submissions and the <mpgrant:ApplicationPackage> XML node for multi-project submissions along with each submission attachment.When creating the attachment XML, it is important to specify "SHA-1" in the Global Schema "glob:hashAlgorithm" attribute. If a value other thanSHA-1is received in the XML, Grants.gov will reject the application. The next sections describe the process in greater detail. This section clarifies the process of sending attachments to Grants.gov. The Attachments schema is required when adding attachments to a S2S grant application package. The schema containing the AttachedFileDataType can be accessed by the URL: https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/system/schemas/GlobalLibrary-V1.0.xsd. The schema contains a field namedFileLocation. This element represents the Content-ID (CID) for the attachment, which is a unique value for identifying the associated attachment. Thehrefattribute of theFileLocationelement should be populated with the CID. The CID (theFileLocation hrefattribute value) in the schema should match the FileContentIdelement contained in the GrantsCommonElements:Attachment element. The GrantsCommonElementsschema can be accessed by the URL: https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/system/schemas/GrantsCommonElements-V1.0.xsd The following restrictions apply to both single and multi-project submissions: Each attachment must be hashed and the value placed in the attachmentHashValueXML element of the Submission XML.

<TEXT>
Grants.gov Community Blog Connecting the grant community to #LearnGrants Developing a proofreading strategy can greatly improve the quality of your federal grant application. Here are some tips from grant-making offices across the government that you can use for developing this strategy.  Request that your colleagues or mentors review a first draft of your specific aims early in the process, advises NIH. Consider asking your early proofreaders to focus on macro issues, such as the organization of narrative sections or the logical flow within your application narrative. Even if your proposal is not completely ready, you can still have your designated proofreaders review some sections of the proposal. An Office of Justice Programs resource concurs, stating that early proofreading will allow for sufficient time to deal with missing information, as well as other common issues. Continue reading Tips for Proofreading Your Next GrantApplication Need statements, program narratives, and discussions of impact arent the only parts of a federal grant application that require the touch of a good writer. The budget narrative sometimes called the budget justification or budget detail can also benefit from a skilled wordsmith. Here, though, the burden carried by the writer weighs heaviest in the areas of precision, thoroughness and organization and less so in the areas of color and creativity. What follows are budget narrative writing tips that have been curated from a wide range of federal agency resources.  Continue reading Grant Writing: How to Build Credibility with Your BudgetNarrative Lets say that your organization is applying for a federal grant that will support a wildlife reserve restoration project. You craft a need statement that (1) aligns with the grant-making agencys funding opportunity announcement; (2) communicates your organizations experience with restoration projects; and (3) includes several concise but compelling anecdotes illustrating the need for restoration. Now, you and your writing team need to outline the impact that your proposed project will have on the wildlife reserve. Once again, youll want to make sure the impact your team projects aligns with agency goals. You will also need to balance specificity with realism. Below, we continue our grant writing series with tips for defining and projecting the impact of a proposed project. The following tips have been adapted from the U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesHealth Resources & Services Administrations grant writing guide, titled Tips for Writing and Submitting Good Grant Proposals.  In a previous series post, we discussed the role of peer review panels, as well as the criteria they use to evaluate applications. Such panels provide their evaluations to the federal grant-making agencys staff. Continue reading Grant Writing: 3 Tips for Discussing Impact in Federal GrantApplications In this space, we have previously shared tips about the pre-writing phase of completing a federal grant application for example, the importance of reading (and re-reading) the grant announcement, and the importance of understanding the criteria by which your application will be evaluated. In this post, we dip our toes into the grant writing process itself and share some tips about crafting a need statement. These tips are adapted from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources & Services Administrations grant writing guide, titled Tips for Writing and Submitting Good Grant Proposals. Along with each tip, we also include an excerpt from an award-winning federal grant proposal that can be viewed in full on the website of the Institute of Museum and Library Services. (IMLS has an excellent collection of proposals that are worthy of review especially for new federal grant applicants.)  Continue reading Grant Writing: 3 Tips for Crafting Need Statements in Federal GrantProposals When you receive a federal grant, you are receiving taxpayer dollars with the expectation you will successfully implement a public-serving project. Such projects can range from publishing scientific research results to creating apprenticeship opportunities for underrepresented populations to providing foreign aid and democratic development. To ensure you (i.e., the award recipient) are using the funds ethically and efficiently, the federal government establishes grant reporting requirements. After you submit these reports, the grant-making agency then has staff who carefully review them to maintain transparency and to prevent fraud and abuse.  Continue reading Prepare for Reporting Requirements Grant WritingBasics When preparing your federal grant application, you would do well to put yourself and your team in the shoes of the people who will be evaluating it. In this post, we will look specifically at grant opportunities that are evaluated (at least in part) with the aid of a peer review panel (Note: Not all are evaluated in this way).  Continue reading Peer Review Panels and the Federal Grant Application EvaluationsProcess Whether you are writing an email, blog post, or lengthy proposal, you need to consider the question, Who is my audience? In the grants world, your audience will usually be the agency awarding funds and the people reviewing your application.  The process of learning about a grant-making agency is closely related to evaluating mission alignment, so this next installment of the Grant Writing Basics series assumes that (1) your organizations mission aligns with that of the grant-making agency and that (2) you are actively preparing to write a grant application. Continue reading Grant Writing Basics: Understand the Funder beforeWriting As with many projects in life, it is best to begin your planning and writing as early as you can. When applying for federal grants, the OMB Uniform Guidance sets forth a 30 to 60 day range for federal funding opportunities to be open: (b) The Federal awarding agency must generally make all funding opportunities available for application for at least 60 calendar days. The Federal awarding agency may make a determination to have a less than 60 calendar day availability period but no funding opportunity should be available for less than 30 calendar days unless exigent circumstances require as determined by the Federal awarding agency head or delegate. 200.203(b) A reasonable follow-up question to this is what to do if you would like to begin working on a grant application more than two months in advance.  Continue reading Grant Writing Basics: How to Start Working on Future FundingOpportunities It is easy to be intimidated when you first encounter a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) on Grants.gov. There are the four tabs of content. The technical language culled from industry and government programs. Application forms, some of which may require file attachments. And, of course, there is the shiver-inducing closing date.

To verify if you have a compatible version of Adobe Acrobat Reader installed, click on the following test Workspace PDF form link: VERIFY ADOBE VERSIONING TEST WORKSPACE PDF FORM Adobe Acrobat Reader is free desktop software developed by Adobe, a private software company. Adobe continuously provides new versions of the application to include product and/or security updates, so Adobe strongly recommends using the latest versions. Note: Grants.gov may not be able to fully test the most recent version(s). Users are urged to verify their Adobe Acrobat Reader software's compatibility by using the test Workspace PDF form link above. Adobe Acrobat Standard/Professional (Version 10 or later) may be used in place of Adobe Acrobat Reader when completing Workspace PDF forms on Grants.gov. However, only the free Adobe Acrobat Reader software is needed. If more than one person is filling out a Workspace PDF form, Grants.gov recommends that the same version of Adobe Acrobat Reader software be used by each person to avoid version compatibility issues. Check the version number of the Adobe Acrobat Reader software on each user's computer to make sure the versions match. Using different versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader may cause submission and/or save errors even if each version is individually compatible with Grants.gov. Security settings on your local network or computer could impact your use of Adobe Acrobat Reader. Please consider the following: To trust PDF files in Adobe Acrobat Reader: Find registration, search, and application instructions for all users in the Grants.gov Online User Guide. For detailed applicant information, review the Applicants section of the online user guide. Contact the Grants.gov Support Center to get help from a representative.

<TITLE>Certificates    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Agencies are required to obtain and install a personal user authentication certificate on their application server in order to use the system-to-system feature with Grants.gov. There are three steps to this process: (1) obtaining the correct type of digital certificate, (2) requesting installation of the certificate, and (3) authorizing the certificate in Grants.gov. Your personal user authentication certificate must be purchased from a recognized Certificate Authority (CA) such as Comodo, DigiCert, Entrust, GoDaddy, Incommon, Symantec, or Thawte, and then sent to Grants.gov for installation. Your certificate must have a 2048 bit public RSA key and use a SHA-2 based digital signature (for example SHA256RSA), so care must be taken when ordering your certificate. Personal user authentication certificates may be difficult to find on the Certificate Authority websites, so we recommend that you contact sales departments directly and explain that you need a 2048 bit SSL client certificate that uses SHA-2. Some certificate authorities do not issue certificates valid for client authentication by default. You may need to explicitly request a certificate with the client authentication attribute included. Below is an example of a certificate valid for Client Authentication:  Additionally, you must utilize Port 443 with the SHA-2 based digital signature. Please note that all intermediate certificates in the certificate chain must also be SHA-2 in order to work with port 443. Note that you are responsible for monitoring your certificate expiration date in order to obtain a renewal from the CA before your certificate expires. Renewed certificates must also be sent to Grants.gov for installation. Grants.gov no longer accepts self-signed certificates as these cannot guarantee your identity and do not meet federal security standards. Once you have obtained a certificate, fill out theCertificate Request Formand return to Grants.gov by following the instructions on the form. Grants.gov will notify you by email once it has been installed. You have the option to use separate certificates for the Production and Training environments or to use a single certificate for both environments. After installation of the certificate, the Agency Grants.gov POC must log in to Grants.gov, click "Manage Grantor Certificates", select the newly-installed certificate, and assign roles.

What is an RSS feed? An RSS feed is a stream of information that can be delivered conveniently and automatically through a simple application. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) information is transferred as XML code. Subscribing to an RSS feed is an easy way to keep up with news and information that's important to you, without having to browse or search for information on websites. What is an RSS reader? An RSS reader is a piece of software that collects and displays an RSS feed's XML information in a form that people can read. RSS readers allow users to manage and organize their feed subscriptions in a central location. Where can I get an RSS reader? Some browsers have built-in RSS readers. If you are using a browser that doesn't currently support RSS, an online search will quickly produce a range of options. Most RSS Readers are free to download and use. How do I use RSS Feeds? The process of adding an RSS feed differs slightly from one RSS reader to the next. Follow the steps below to add a new feed (also referred to as a "channel") to your RSS reader: Using RSS Feeds: Grants.gov introduced the Opportunity Modification RSS feeds as an alternative to receiving multiple emails for updates to grant opportunities. Now, applicants can view at their convenience and in one place all new grant opportunities and updates to existing grant opportunities. Available RSS Feeds: New Opportunities by Agency- Receive a listing of new opportunities by agency name. New Opportunities by Category- Receive a listing of new opportunities by category. Modified Opportunities by Agency- Receive a listing of recently modified opportunities by agency name. Modified Opportunities by Category- Receive a listing of recently modified opportunities by category.

<TITLE>Submitting UTF-8 Special Characters    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Grants.gov is configured to receive and transfer all UTF-8 characters, which includes those characters commonly referred to as "special characters." Examples of special characters include the tilde (~), letters with accent marks (), and Greek letters (). Grants.gov will receive and transfer all UTF-8 characters as they are entered into Grants.gov via: (1) PDF and S2S submissions (2) User interface (UI) entry (3) System-to-system (S2S) connection  Why does this matter for Applicants? Applicants are able to enter all special characters from the UTF-8 character set when submitting applications and information to Grants.gov. However, if the grantor's system is not yet compatible with these special characters, the grantor system may produce garbled or missing text in the application. As a result, the application may be rejected. Applicants should also identify whether the system they use to apply to Grants.gov is compatible with special characters in the UTF-8 character set. If the applicant system is not compatible, but the applicant still enters special characters, then Grants.gov may receive garbled or missing data which will be transferred to the grantor. Applicant Actions:  Read all the instructions provided by the grantor, which may include instructions not to use certain special characters. Check your grant application systems for compatibility with special characters in the UTF-8 character set, if applicable.  Why does this matter for Grantors? Grants.gov will transfer the special characters in an application exactly as received. However, if the grantor's systems, including S2S, are not compatible with the entire UTF-8 character set, then the grantor systems will not be able to read the special characters. The result may be garbled or missing data in applications. Grantor Actions:  Upgrade your system to accept special characters in the UTF-8 character set. Include instructions to applicants which special characters cannot be submitted in applications. Special Character Impact Summary Table Applicant UTF-8 Compatibility Grantor UTF-8 Compatibility Applicant Impact Grantor Impact PDF Applicant using UTF-8 Compatible Package  Applicant S2S with applicant system not UTF-8 Compatible Applicant S2S with applicant system UTF-8 Compatible   Review the application instructions provided by the award-making agency for their attachment restrictions. You should also review the instructions on the form you are completing. If there are no restrictions for file names identified by the agency or in the form, then the file name restrictions are as follows: We are seeing issues (i.e. "java.lang.Exception: 16 errors") when submissions are not following the filename restrictions. Below are two examples where the system returned "error 16" when an applicant used an incorrect filename: EXAMPLE 1 [2009-02-11 11:17:46,610][FATAL][GrantS2SFacade.submitApplication()1377]-Couldn't completely receive Submission due to unknown Exception.

What is a grant? A grant is a way the government funds your ideas and projects to provide public services and stimulate the economy. Grants support critical recovery initiatives, innovative research, and many other programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). A grant is one of many different forms of federal financial assistance. Federal financial assistance is a broad term to refer to the various ways the U.S. government redistributes resources to eligible recipients. On Grants.gov you will find grant and cooperative agreement opportunities from federal agencies that award grants. The grant process follows a linear lifecycle that includes creating the funding opportunity, applying, making award decisions, and successfully implementing the award. Check out the Grant Lifecycle page to find out what the applicant and the grant-making agency do in the lifecycle. The specific actions along the lifecycle are grouped into three main phases. Each of the three phases has its own page that provides a more detailed look at the process: Confused about the different types of federal grants?

The main objective of this section is to provide sample Test Cases that can be used to test your Agency interface to the Grants.gov Training Environment (https://training.grants.gov) using the Web Service Library. Below is a list of web services that will be tested: Any web service method can be used to perform a connectivity test with Grants.gov. Web Service(s) Included in Test CreateAdobeOpportunity Prerequisite(s): Objective: Verify that the connection with Grants.gov is working properly by conducting a simple test. In our example, we will create an opportunity using the web service and validate it by manually logging into Grants.gov. Please note that Create Adobe Opportunity web service was used as an example for this connectivity test. Test Procedures: Step 1: Publish an opportunity with a synopsis by invoking the portion of your system which calls the CreateAdobeOpportunity web service. Please make a note of your Opportunity Number for future verification. Step 2: Check your return values to validate the web service ran correctly. Generally, these are found in your application logs or displayed on the screen in your system user interface. Step 3: Verify if opportunity has been published by navigating to Grants.gov Training environment at https://training.grants.gov. This can be done in 2 ways. Expected Results: The system successfully invoked the Grants.gov web service to create a funding opportunity in the Grants.gov Training Environment with a synopsis as verified in the last step. Web Service(s) Included in Test ManagePackage Prerequisites: Objective: The objective of this test case is to create a package under the previously created opportunity so that applications can be submitted. Test Procedures: Step 1: Login to the Grants.gov Training Environment to view and select an existing template to use for the package. We are suggesting an existing template be used to simplify the test. However, you may create a new template if you prefer. Step 2: Create a package for the Opportunity created in Test Case 2.1 by invoking the portion of your system which calls the ManagePackage web service. We suggest you specify the package is for both individuals and organization applicants for ease of testing. Please make note of the Funding Opportunity Number for later verification. Step 3: Check your return values to validate the web services for Step 2 ran correctly. Generally, these are found in your application logs or displayed on the screen in your systems user interface. Step 4: Verify if package has been published by navigating to Grants.gov Training environment at https://training.grants.gov. This can be done in 3 ways. Expected Results: The system successfully invoked the Grants.gov web service to create a funding opportunity package in the Grants.gov Training Environment as verified in the last step. Web Service(s) Included in Test: GetApplicationList GetApplicationZip ConfirmApplicationDelivery AssignAgencyTrackingNumber (optional) Prerequisites: Note: In order to submit applications to your opportunity, you will need applicant test account(s). The easiest way to create an applicant test account is to register as an individual applicant in the Grants.gov Training Environment by specifying a funding opportunity number. Objective: The objective of this test case is to download all submissions for an opportunity and store them in the agency system including setting the proper status in Grants.gov. This test case assumes the agency system was developed to implement all the associated retrieve application web services in a single process. If not, the web services and be tested separately. Test Procedures: Step 1: Search and download the package created in Test Case 2.2, complete the PDF form, and submit one or more applications using your test applicant account(s). Step 2: Download the submissions made in Step 1 by invoking the portion of your system which retrieves applications and stores them in your agency data store. This should first invoke the GetApplicantList web service to determine if there are applications needing to be downloaded. If applications are available, the GetApplicationZip web service is invoked to download the application and its attachments. To notify Grants.gov and applicants that the application was successfully downloaded, the ConfirmApplicationDelivery web service is invoked. The AssignAgencyTrackingNumber web service is only needed if your agency would like to store your internal tracking number on Grants.gov. Step 3: Check your return values to validate the web services from Step 2 ran correctly. Generally, these are found in your application logs. Step 4: Verify the application status and your agency tracking number, if applicable, in the Grants.gov Training environment at https://training.grants.gov. This can be done in 3 ways. Step 5: Verify receipt of Grants.gov email notifications. Expected Results: The system successfully invoked the Grants.gov web services to retrieve the applications as verified in the last two steps. Web Service(s) Included in Test UpdateAdobeOpportunity Prerequisites: Objective: The objective of this test case is to modify the previously created opportunity synopsis. Test Procedures: Step 1: Modify the opportunity created in Test Case 2.1 by invoking the portion of your system which calls the web service UpdateAdobeOpportunity. Step 2: Check your return values to validate the web service from Step 1. Generally, these are found in your program logs or displayed on the screen in your system user interface. Step 3: Verify if opportunity has been updated using the same mechanism as you used to check the created opportunity in Test Case 2.1. Expected Results: The system successfully updated the opportunity as verified in the last step. Web Service(s) Included in Test DeleteAdobeOpportunity Prerequisites: Objective: The objective of this test case is to delete the previously created opportunity synopsis. Test Procedures: Step 1: Delete the opportunity created in Test Case 2.1 by invoking the portion of your system which calls the web service DeleteAdobeOpportunity. Step 2: Check your return values to validate the web service from step 1. Generally, these are found in your program logs or displayed on the screen in your system user interface. Step 3: Verify if opportunity has been deleted using the same mechanism as you used to check the created opportunity in Test Case 2.1. The opportunity should no longer be found. Expected Results: The system successfully deleted the opportunity as verified in the last step.

<TITLE>Applicant Eligibility    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Before beginning the application process, you should make sure you or your organization is eligible to apply for the grant. There are two keys to eligibility: Where do you find this information? Here's a link to the Get Registered section. For the full legal eligibility requirements, you need to carefully read the Application Instructions that are attached to every funding opportunity in Grants.gov. The awarding agencies define eligibility in those instructions, and they may also summarize the eligibility in the Synopsis Details section. If you don't double check that you are eligible in the Application Instructions, you could waste a lot of time and money completing the application process for a grant you cannot legally receive, regardless of how well you write your application. Wondering who comes up with the eligibility? Check out the Grant Eligibility section of Learn Grants for details on how eligibility is defined and what types of funding you or your organization can generally apply for. Find registration, search, and application instructions for all users in the Grants.gov Online User Guide. For detailed applicant information, review the Applicants section of the online user guide.

<TITLE>Grant Fraud    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Every year, hundreds of billions of dollars are distributed in the form of federal grants to universities, local governments, organizations and individuals. The vast majority of these funds are spent as intended, but misuse, deceit and abuse are nonetheless present. As a result, hundreds of thousand dollars go to waste. Fraudulent behavior can take the form of embezzlement, theft, bribery or false claims and statements. Such violations of federal law are difficult to flag without the help of individuals inside the grant community. Learn how you can help to stop fraudulent behavior and, thus, strengthen the integrity of the federal grant system and increase the overall efficiency of the government. Grant fraud typically occurs when award recipients attempt to deceive the government about their spending of award money. Such behavior amounts to "lying, cheating and stealing," according to the Department of Justice. The allure of so-called "free money" from the federal government has enabled scam artists to prey on people's hopes by promising access to grants often for a fee. In reality, federal grants are rarely awarded to individuals seeking personal benefits, and applying for a grant is completely free. Besides triggering lost efficiency and waste in the government, grant fraud can also have a significant impact on entities found to have carried it out. The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General warns that consequences can include "debarment from receiving future funding, administrative recoveries of funds, civil law suits and criminal prosecution." Federal Inspectors General (IG) within each government agency have been established as independent and objective units tasked with combating waste, fraud, and abuse in their respective programs. Only with your help! The front line of defense against fraudulent behavior in the grant community includes accountants, auditors and other award recipient personnel. If you think you may have been a victim of a government grant scam, file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission online, or call toll-free, 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357); TTY: 1-866-653-4261. You can also report grant-related scam attempts to the Health and Human Services (HHS) Fraud Hotline at 1-800-447-8477.

The instructions below are for new organizations or organizations that have never applied for a federal grant before. Most applicants work for organizations that already completed these steps to do business with the federal government. Before your organization can apply for a federal grant, there are several steps an organization must complete outside of Grants.gov prior to submitting an application through Grants.gov. An organization is an entity that submits grant applications on behalf of the group, such as a state government, nonprofit organization, or a private business. Once you form a legal entity with a Employer Identification Number (EIN), you are ready to complete the steps below. Below are the main steps and links to more information to complete this process. The process below can take between three business days and five weeks, so please make sure to begin early. If you do not complete these steps by the submission deadline, you are unlikely to be allowed to submit an application. Contact the federal agency point of contact listed in the grant opportunity to discuss that agency's policy. How do I get a DUNS number? Call 1-866-705-5711 or access the Dun & Bradstreet website http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.  How long does this step usually take? 1-2 business days How do I register with the System Award Management (SAM)? Access https://www.sam.gov and complete the online registration process. You also need the authorizing official of the organization to send a notarized letter to SAM and an EIN. How long does this step usually take? After SAM receives the notarized letter, up to 2 weeks (up to 5 more weeks to acquire EIN)   How do I register a Grants.gov account? Click the Register link in the top banner and complete the on-screen instructions. How long does this step usually take? Same day  NOTE: Passwords expire every 60 days.

<TITLE>Grant Programs    | GRANTS.GOV</TITLE>
<TEXT>
If you are just entering the realm of grants and government funding, it can feel overwhelming trying to find the right program for you or your organization. When considering grants, these programs can be broadly categorized as those awarded by the federal government and those awarded by non-federal entities. Within these two categories are a variety of funding sources and program types. To sort through the federal grant programs, the authoritative source is the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). This catalog lists all of the available funding programs to all levels of government, nonprofit organizations, for-profit businesses, and other eligible entities. Search Grants within Grants.gov allows you to search, filter, and apply for specific opportunities to receive funding from one of these programs. There are a large number of nonprofit organizations and for-profit businesses that also provide grants or other types of funding assistance. Note: The information below is not exhaustive, and Grants.gov is not affiliated with, nor endorsing, any of these resources. They are provided as a convenience to prospective grant applicants. Candid maintains a comprehensive database on U.S. and global grant-makers and their funding opportunities. It also operates research, education, and training programs designed to advance knowledge of philanthropy at every level. Candid's Funding Information Network facilitates access to grant resources and publications to under-resourced entities and populations. State and regional directories can also be found with some research. Try using the Community Foundation Locator to find a grant-making foundation in your region. You may also use your preferred web search engine to find your state's grant or foundation directory. Local libraries may have access to subscription-based search engines or the Foundation Center Cooperating Collections, so visit your library to work with them for assistance. Learn more about federal grant programs in the "Exploring Eligibility" blog series on the Grants.gov Community Blog . Are you an individual person looking for benefits, loans, or assistance from the government? Grants.gov is probably not the site for you, but there are plenty of opportunities available: The first place to look if you are looking for personal funding, such as funding for education, disaster relief, or health care. Use the Benefits Finder tool to identify programs for which you may be eligible. GovLoans.gov This site is helpful if you are looking for any type of personal or business loan. StudentAid.ed.gov You should check out this site if you are looking for education-related funding. This site is the government point-of-entry for federal government contract procurement opportunities over $25,000. This site functions as an entryway to the U.S. Federal Government by providing information on federal agencies and programs, as well as facilitating access to the benefits and services for which you may be eligible.
