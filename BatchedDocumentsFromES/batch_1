<TEXT>
 The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is an agency in the United States Department of Commerce that promotes growth and competitiveness of the United States' minority-owned businesses, including Hispanic and Latino American, Asian Pacific American, African American, and Native American businesses.[1] The current National Director is David J. Byrd.[2] MBDA's stated mission is to promote the growth and competitiveness of minority-owned businesses by providing access to capital, access to contracts and access to market opportunities - both domestic and global. The main feature of the organization and its site is to provide business consulting services to minority business owners.[3] On March 5, 1969, President Richard Nixon issued Executive Order 11458, establishing the Office of Minority Business Enterprise. On October 13, 1971, President Nixon issued Executive Order 11625, which clarified MBDA's authority and expanded the scope of its operations.[4] In 1979, the agency was renamed the Minority Business Development Agency. The agency was cut in President Trump's FY18 Executive budget,[5] but subsequently restored in the President's FY19 budget - the only Federal agency to be restored after its proposed elimination.[6] The Agency holds National Minority Enterprise Development Week in the month of October, observed in the United States to recognize and celebrate the achievements and contributions of the minority business enterprise community. President Ronald Reagan first recognized National MED Week in 1983.[7] The week is formally celebrated each year by the Minority Business Development Agency, a U.S. government agency housed within the U.S. Department of Commerce.[8] On October 20, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation which officially designated October 22 through October 28, 2017 as National Minority Enterprise Development Week.[9][10] On October 24, 2017, President Trump recognized minority-owned businesses in the Oval Office during National MED Week, when he welcomed winners of the National MED Week Awards with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and MBDA Acting National Director Christopher A. Garcia.[11][12] Alkalimat, Abdul. The African American Experience in Cyberspace. Pluto Press, 1994.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Funding Circle offers low rates compared to its competitors. You'll need good personal credit and an established business to qualify. 12.18 - 36.00% 660 Cash can be available within 3 business days. Competitive rates among online lenders. No minimum revenue requirement. Requires business lien and personal guarantee. Not available in Nevada. Applications for the latest round of forgivable PPP loans reopened in January. Small-business owners hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic can apply for first or second loans to help with payroll or other expenses.

You can use the money to cover the costs of buying equipment, hiring employees or opening a new location. Have good credit and an established business: Though the company doesnt have a minimum annual revenue requirement, you do need to be in business for at least two years and have a minimum credit score of 660 to qualify. Are looking for fast cash: Funding Circles application process is quicker and easier than the process to qualify for an SBA loan, and borrowers receive their money within three days on average. Its tough to beat the low interest rates on SBA loans, which are typically in the high single digits. But Funding Circles rates are relatively low among small-business lenders. Its annual percentage rates start around 12% and include a one-time origination fee of between 3.49% and 6.99%.

MORE:Business expansion loans: Find the best option for you It can take just 10 minutes to apply for a Funding Circle loan, and you could receive funds within three days.

Funding Circle requires at least two years of business history, while its borrowers typically have been in business for about 11 years and have annual revenue of $1.6 million and 12 employees. Funding Circle does not have a minimum annual revenue requirement, but other criteria are stricter than competitors. You need a personal credit score of at least 660 to qualify for a Funding Circle loan. Some online lenders accept 600 or lower. The company says the average credit score of its funded borrowers is 700. Funding Circle also requires a lien on your business assets, which may include equipment, vehicles or inventory. Like most other business lenders, it also requires a personal guarantee from the primary business owners, which gives the lender the right to pursue your personal assets if your business fails to repay the loan. Although getting a loan from Funding Circle is faster than from a traditional bank,there are other online lenders, like OnDeck, with even faster funding times. Ifyoud like to compare loan options, NerdWallet has a list of small-business loans that are best for business owners.

<TITLE>Small-Business Funding: Find Financing Options in 2021 - NerdWallet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesnt feature every company or financial product available on the market, were proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. The top sources of small-business funding include loans from banks, credit unions and online lenders. Small-business funding is necessary to launch, maintain or grow a business. You can get financing by taking on debt, likesmall-business loansfrom traditional banks and online alternative lenders, or offering investors equity. To help you find a good fit, here are six of the most common funding options for small businesses.  MORE:Debt vs. equity financing: Which is right for you? For: Established businesses with collateral and strong credit. Traditional banks are a great starting point and can help you figure out where you stand in terms of qualifying for funding. Even if your business doesnt have a strong enough track record or enough assets as collateral to qualify for a bank loan, talking to someone at a traditional bank can help you figure out what documents you need and what your best options may be. Locally owned banks, in particular, are a great resource for small business financing because they often have a strong interest in economic development in the community. Community banks hold 36% of small business loans, according to a 2020 report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Types of small-business funding offered by banks include term loans, SBA loans and business lines of credit.  MORE:How to get a business loan For:Businesses who don't meettraditional banks' strict lending criteria. The U.S. Small Business Administration offers lenders, mostly traditional banks, a federal guarantee on your loan. This makesit less risky for banks to lend you the funds you need to be successful. In guaranteeing the loans, the SBA also connects you with favorable rates offered by traditional lenders. And unlike most bank loans, you can use an SBA loan to start a business. However, the application process isnt easy, and you can find yourself trapped under a heap of documents while you work through the appropriate forms. For: People withshaky personal credit, who want fast funding or ease of applying. With traditional banks limiting access to capital, online lenders have seen an increase in popularity, especially amongowners struggling with bad credit:51% of medium- or high-risk credit applicants apply to online lenders, according to a 2020 report from the Federal Reserve. Online lenders also offerfast cash, with several of them able to turn around funding within 24 hours. Peer-to-peer business lenders are among the alternatives. These lenders cut out the traditional middleman, such as banks, to connect borrowers with individual and institutional investors. The cost of borrowing, however, is much higher; some charge annual percentage rates close to 100%. Still, alternative lenders are an option when a bank says no. Online lenders offer a variety of small-business financing options, including term loans, lines of credit and invoice financing. Use NerdWalletsbusiness loan calculatorto figure out your monthly payment on a loan. For: Businesses with products that can capture the public's interest. Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter rely on investors to help get an idea or business off the ground, often rewarding them with perks or equity in exchange for cash. Although the popularity of these services has increased in recent years,there are caveats. For one, your product or company has to be intriguing enough to catch the eye of multiple investors. In the case of equity crowdfunding, where investors gain a stake in the company, there are strict securities laws and rules to follow for investors and entrepreneurs alike. For:Members who like a personal touch. Like banks, credit unions offer favorable rates and loans backed by the SBA. But unlike banks, credit unions have increased their small-business funding. Between 2004 and 2020,the number of credit unions offering small business financing doubled, according to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Youll likely have to be a member. But the co-op nature of credit unions often ties them to the community, so you may also reap the benefits of more personal relationships and name recognition.  MORE: Best loan options for women-owned businesses For:Free financing. Small business grants offer a way for business owners to get established or grow, without having to worry about paying back the funds. Typically offered through nonprofits, government agencies and corporations, some grants focus on specific types of business owners, such as minorities, veterans and women. The downside to free financing is that everybody wants it. It will take a lot of work to find and apply to grants, but time spent searching for free money opportunities could pay off in the long run. It can depend on the stage of your business. If you're just starting out, consider self-funding your business or explore startup business loans. If you have at least a year in business and solid personal and business finances, you have more options, such as SBA loans and other types of business financing. The U.S. government does not actually provide small-business financing. However, it does offer a guarantee on business loans issued by traditional banks and other lenders to qualified businesses. BecauseSBA loans are backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, they have lower interest rates and more flexible qualifications than traditional bank loans. The SBA and other federal agencies also provide free assistance and in some cases small-business grants through various programs to help small business owners.

Since our earliest days, hardworking entrepreneurs have driven our Nation's prosperity. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we recognize the contributions that minority-owned businesses make to our economy and our way of life, and we strive to ensure that small business owners have access to the resources they need to achieve the American Dream. The United States is entering upon a new period of economic revival. Unemployment is at a 16-year low, businesses are expanding, and wages are rising. Ensuring that minority-owned businesses remain strong and vibrant is vital to the growth of our great Nation. Minority-owned firms employ eight million people and generate more than $1 trillion in annual economic output. They export their products at a greater rate than non-minority businesses and provide a great boost to our global competitiveness. My Administration is committed to creating a business climate in which minority business enterprises can thrive and expand. The Unified Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code, my Administration's basic plan for tax cuts and tax reform, calls for a steep reduction to the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent. This reform will lift up our entrepreneurs, our businesses, and our families. The Framework also caps the top tax rate for millions of family-owned and small- and mid-sized businesses at 25 percentthe lowest it has been in more than 80 years. We also want Americans to be able to invest in capital to build their businesses, so for 5 years, we will allow them to deduct 100 percent of their capital investments. By eliminating needless regulations, promoting fair and reciprocal trade relationships, lowering taxes, and increasing the flow of capital, the United States will further cement its status as a global economic powerhouse. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we recommit to empowering every hardworking American to write our next great chapter. Let us work together to ensure that every American citizen can flourish and give back to our country and our communities. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 22 through October 28, 2017, as National Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon all Americans to celebrate this week with programs, ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of American minority business enterprises. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.

<TITLE>Trump promises "jobs, jobs, jobs" - CBS News</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Watch CBSN Live  Updated on: October 24, 2017 / 2:15 PM / CBS News President Trump welcomed minority business leaders to the White House Tuesday morning for an awards ceremony, praising their accomplishments as entrepreneurs while also taking a moment to re-emphasize his administration's tax reform goals. "Our plan can be simplified in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs," Mr. Trump said, promising that the White House's tax reform blueprint will create job opportunities. Chief of staff John Kelly attended the ceremony, as did Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr. Trump congratulated the nine winners of the National Minority Enterprise Development Week Awards, which is a project of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency. The president emphasized the importance of "reciprocal trade" to the development of business generally. "We're way ahead of schedule" in renegotiating U.S. free trade deals, Mr. Trump declared, mentioning NAFTA in particular. "If [renegotiation] doesn't turn out, we'll have to do a new NAFTA," he said. "Each of you has a remarkable past and an even more remarkable future," the president told the award winners. "Especially with Trump as your president." "I talked a lot about the inner cities on the campaign trail," he added later. "There's a lot of potential in the inner cities." The president also plugged positive economic indicatorsthe lowest jobless claims since 1973, and a record-high stock marketbefore moving on to tax reform. "If we get this passed, and I really hope we will," Trump said, tax reform will spur job creation and bring, he estimated, $4 trillion in economic value from overseas back into the U.S. economy. "Nobody even knows the amount," he added. Mr. Trump also mentioned the potential for renegotiation on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), saying "we'll see how it turns out," on the deal. The ceremony is part of Minority Enterprise Development Week at the White House Tuesday morning, a week he designated Sundayto recognize with "programs, ceremonies and activities to recognize the many contributions of American minority business enterprises," according to an official White House proclamation. "We are in your debt," Mr. Trump said to those receiving awards. "You inspire our children to develop their talents and always chase their dreams." "Our plan can be simplified in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs," Mr. Trump said. The president then congratulated those receiving awards, and concluded his opening statement. He did not take questions from reporters and posed for a photo-op with the visitors. Mr. Trump said that the White House's tax reform goals will put "America first." "I think we have to as a country," he said. He claimed that the tax reform blueprint will bring back trillions of dollars to the economy, but did not cite specific information for doing so. "We are in your debt. You inspire our children to develop their talents and always chase their dreams," Mr. Trump said. The president claimed that his administration is working to lift barriers in the way of business development and claimed that the stock market is "the highest it's ever been in history, by far." "Those days are over," Mr. Trump said of NAFTA, adding that the United States will need to re-negotiate the deal. This is a developing story and will be updated.

Subscribe The Minority Business Development Agency was established by Executive order in 1969. The Agency develops and coordinates a national program for minority business enterprise. The Agency was created to assist minority businesses in achieving effective and equitable participation in the American free enterprise system and in overcoming social and economic disadvantages that have limited their participation in the past. The Agency provides national policies and leadership in forming and strengthening a partnership of business, industry, and government with the Nation's minority businesses. Business development services are provided to the minority business community through three vehicles: the minority business opportunity committees which disseminate information on business opportunities; the minority business development centers that provide management and technical assistance and other business development services; and electronic commerce which includes a Web page on the Internet that will show how to start a business and use the service to electronically match business with contract opportunities. The Agency promotes and coordinates the efforts of other Federal agencies in assisting or providing market opportunities for minority business. It coordinates opportunities for minority firms in the private sector. Through such public and private cooperative activities, the Agency promotes the participation of Federal, State, and local governments, and business and industry in directing resources for the development of strong minority businesses.

<TITLE>Minority group - Wikipedia</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A minority group, by its original definition, refers to a group of people whose practices, race, religion, ethnicity, or other characteristics are fewer in numbers than the main groups of those classifications. However, in present-day sociology, a minority group refers to a category of people who experience relative disadvantage as compared to members of a dominant social group.[1] Minority group membership is typically based on differences in observable characteristics or practices, such as: ethnicity (ethnic minority), race (racial minority), religion (religious minority), sexual orientation (sexual minority), or disability.[2] Utilizing the framework of intersectionality, it is important to recognize that an individual may simultaneously hold membership in multiple minority groups (e.g. both a racial and religious minority).[3][failed verification] Likewise, individuals may also be part of a minority group in regard to some characteristics, but part of a dominant group in regard to others.[3] The term "minority group" often occurs within the discourse of civil rights and collective rights, as members of minority groups are prone to differential treatment in the countries and societies in which they live.[4] Minority group members often face discrimination in multiple areas of social life, including housing, employment, healthcare, and education, among others.[5][6] While discrimination may be committed by individuals, it may also occur through structural inequalities, in which rights and opportunities are not equally accessible to all.[7] The language of minority rights is often used to discuss laws designed to protect minority groups from discrimination and afford them equal social status to the dominant group.[8] Louis Wirth defined a minority group as "a group of people who, because of their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination".[9] The definition includes both objective and subjective criteria: membership of a minority group is objectively ascribed by society, based on an individual's physical or behavioral characteristics; it is also subjectively applied by its members, who may use their status as the basis of group identity or solidarity.[10] Thus, minority group status is categorical in nature: an individual who exhibits the physical or behavioral characteristics of a given minority group is accorded the status of that group and is subject to the same treatment as other members of that group.[9] Joe Feagin, states that a minority group has five characteristics: (1) suffering discrimination and subordination, (2) physical and/or cultural traits that set them apart, and which are disapproved by the dominant group, (3) a shared sense of collective identity and common burdens, (4) socially shared rules about who belongs and who does not determine minority status, and (5) tendency to marry within the group.[11] There is a controversy with the use of the word minority, as it has a generic and an academic usage.[12] Common usage of the term indicates a statistical minority; however, academics refer to power differences among groups rather than differences in population size among groups.[13] The above criticism is based on the idea that a group can be considered minority even if it includes such a large number of people that it is numerically not a minority in society. Some sociologists have criticized the concept of "minority/majority", arguing this language excludes or neglects changing or unstable cultural identities, as well as cultural affiliations across national boundaries.[14] As such, the term historically excluded groups (HEGs) is often similarly used to highlight the role of historical oppression and domination, and how this results in the under-representation of particular groups in various areas of social life.[15] The term national minority is often used to discuss minority groups in international and national politics.[16] All countries contain some degree of racial, ethnic, or linguistic diversity.[17] In addition, minorities may also be immigrant, indigenous or landless nomadic communities.[18] This often results in variations in language, culture, beliefs, practices, that set some groups apart from the dominant group. As these differences are usually perceived negatively, this results in loss of social and political power for members of minority groups.[19] There is no legal definition of national minorities in international law, though protection of minority groups is outlined by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. International criminal law can protect the rights of racial or ethnic minorities in a number of ways.[20] The right to self-determination is a key issue. The Council of Europe regulates minority rights in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. In some places, subordinate ethnic groups may constitute a numerical majority, such as Blacks in South Africa under apartheid.[21] In the United States, for example, non-Hispanic Whites constitute the majority (63.4%) and all other racial and ethnic groups (Mexican, African Americans, Asian Americans, American Indian, and Native Hawaiians) are classified as "minorities".[22] If the non-Hispanic White population falls below 50% the group will only be the plurality, not the majority. There is inadequate evidence whether mass media targeting ethnic minorities are more effective in changing health behaviours such as smoking cessation, weight reduction and food habits when compared to mass media intended for the general population.[23] Also known as "castelike minorities," involuntary minorities are a term for people who were originally brought into any society against their will. In the United States, for instance, it includes but is not limited to Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, African Americans,[24] and native-born Mexican Americans.[25] For reasons of cultural differences, involuntary minorities may experience difficulties in school more than members of other (voluntary) minority groups. Social capital helps children engage with different age groups that share a common goal.[26] Immigrants take on minority status in their new country, usually in hopes of a better future economically, educationally, and politically than in their homeland. Because of their focus on success, voluntary minorities are more likely to do better in school than other migrating minorities.[24] Adapting to a very different culture and language make difficulties in the early stages of life in the new country. Voluntary immigrants do not experience a sense of divided identity as much as involuntary minorities and are often rich in social capital because of their educational ambitions.[26] Major immigrant groups in the United States include Mexicans, Central and South Americans, Cubans, Africans, Asians, and Indians.[25] The term sexual minority is frequently used by public health researchers to recognize a wide variety of individuals who engage in same-sex sexual behavior, including those who do not identify under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. For example, men who have sex with men (MSM), but do not identify as gay. In addition, the term gender minorities can include many types of gender variant people, such as intersex people, transgender people, or non-binary individuals. However, the terms sexual and gender minority are often not preferred by LGBTQ+ people, as they represent clinical categories rather than individual identity.[27] Though lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people have existed throughout human history, LGBTQ+ rights movements across many western countries led to the recognition of LGBTQ+ people as members of a minority group.[27] LGBTQ+ people represent a numerical and social minority. They experience numerous social inequalities stemming from their group membership as LGBTQ+ people. These inequalities include social discrimination and isolation, unequal access to healthcare, employment, and housing, and experience negative mental and physical health outcomes due to these experiences.[27] Leading up to the Human Rights Act 1998 in the UK, a rise in the awareness relating to how people with disabilities were being treated began. Many started to believe that they were being denied basic human rights. This act had a section that stated if authorities did not protect people with learning disabilities from others actions such as harm or neglect, then they could be prosecuted.[28] The disability rights movement has contributed to an understanding of people with disabilities as a minority or a coalition of minorities who are disadvantaged by society, not just as people who are disadvantaged by their impairments. Advocates of disability rights emphasize the difference in physical or psychological functioning, rather than inferiority. For example, some people with autism argue for acceptance of neurodiversity, much as opponents of racism argue for acceptance of ethnic diversity. The deaf community is often regarded as a linguistic and cultural minority rather than a group with disabilities, and some deaf people do not see themselves as having a disability at all. Rather, they are disadvantaged by technologies and social institutions that are designed to cater for the dominant group. (See the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.) People belonging to religious minorities have a faith which is different from that held by the majority. Most countries of the world have religious minorities. It is now widely accepted in the west that people should have the freedom to choose their own religion, including not having any religion (atheism and/or agnosticism), and including the right to convert from one religion to another. However, in many countries this freedom is constricted. In Egypt, a new system of identity cards[29] requires all citizens to state their religionand the only choices are Islam, Christianity, or Judaism (See Egyptian identification card controversy). Another example is the case of decreasing population of minorities in Pakistan, where they are being forcefully converted or killed.[30][31] In most societies, numbers of men and women are not equal. Though women are not categorically a minority,[32] the status of women as a subordinate group has led to many social scientists to study them as a minority group.[33] Though women's legal rights and status vary widely across countries, women experience social inequalities relative to men in most societies.[34] Women are often denied access to education, subject to violence, and lack access to the same economic opportunities as men.[35] In the politics of some countries, a "minority" is an ethnic group recognized by law, and having specified rights. Speakers of a legally recognized minority language, for instance, might have the right to education or communication with the government in their mother tongue. Countries with special provisions[which?] for minorities include Canada, China, Ethiopia, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Croatia, and the United Kingdom.[citation needed] The various minority groups in a country are often not given equal treatment. Some groups are too small or indistinct to obtain minority protections. For example, a member of a particularly small ethnic group might be forced to check "Other" on a checklist of different backgrounds and so might receive fewer privileges than a member of a more defined group. Many contemporary governments prefer to assume the people they rule all belong to the same nationality rather than separate ones based on ethnicity. The United States asks for race and ethnicity on its official census forms, which thus breaks up and organizes its population into sub-groups, primarily racial rather than national. Spain does not divide its nationals by ethnic group, although it does maintain an official notion of minority languages. Some especially significant or powerful minorities receive comprehensive protection and political representation. For example, the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the three constitutive nations, none of which constitutes a numerical majority (see nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina). However, other minorities such as Romani[36] and Jews, are officially labelled "foreign" and are excluded from many of these protections. For example, they may be excluded from political positions, including the presidency.[37] There is debate over recognizing minority groups and their privileges. One view[38] is that the application of special rights to minority groups may harm some countries, such as new states in Africa or Latin America not founded on the European nation-state model, since minority recognition may interfere with establishing a national identity. It may hamper the integration of the minority into mainstream society, perhaps leading to separatism or supremacism. In Canada, some[who?] feel that the failure of the dominant English-speaking majority to integrate French Canadians has provoked Quebec separatism. Others assert that minorities require specific protections to ensure that they are not marginalised: for example, bilingual education may be needed to allow linguistic minorities to fully integrate into the school system and compete equally in society. In this view, rights for minorities strengthen the nation-building project, as members of minorities see their interests well served, and willingly accept the legitimacy of the nation and their integration (not assimilation) within it.[39]

October 3, 1983 Thank you, and welcome to the White House. We are here today to celebrate the contributions of minority business to American economic life, and we're also here to encourage the development of minority business itself. Having one's own business is a powerful engine for social and economic progress. Countless of our minority citizens are taking advantage of the opportunity called free enterprise. It's very fitting that today we acknowledge what minority business people are doing, not just for themselves and their families but for our nation. You know, there were some hearings on the Hill the other day on the way minorities, especially black and Hispanic Americans, are portrayed on television. And if you'll bear with me for a moment, it relates to what we're doing here today. Many who spoke at the hearing believe that television very often stereotypes minorities and ignores their range of talents and interests. Well, let me put on my old actors' union hat for a moment, because there's some truth in that. There are hundreds of thousands of small business men and women in this country who are black or Hispanic, as you well know. Why can't the casting directors more frequently assign parts as shopowners and business people to minorities? After all, there are 600,000 minority businesses in this nation. Now, our minority actors should also get parts as lawyers and doctors, even cowboys -- there were a great many black cowboys in our history. You know, this isn't the first time I've said things like this because for six terms I was president of the Screen Actors Guild, my union, and, believe me, we were working on this very problem then as a union. But minority business people contribute a great deal to our economic well-being, and I think it's time that they are recognized more, including on television and the screen. And recognition is one reason for Minority Enterprise Development Week, and why we're here. We also have some awards, as you've seen, that symbolize what minority business people are doing out there in the American economy. And let me first, if I may, recognize, as you already have, the winners of the Small Business Administration 8(a) Contractors of the Year Award. As you know, the 8(a) program, you've been told, provides greater access for minorities to government contracts. Since 1968, over $15 billion in Federal procurement contracts have been directed toward minority-owned businesses. Our winners today participated in that program, and I'm very pleased to congratulate our co-winners: Mr. Jaime Torres, of El Paso, Texas, the founder of J. T. Construction, and Mr. Norris Carson, the founder of N. L. Carson Construction of Carthage, Mississippi. And let me also congratulate all the regional winners and say that the Nation is just as proud of your contributions. And we wish you, too, continued success. The other award is the Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the Minority Business Development Agency at the Department of Commerce. MBDA, as it's called, provides managerial and technical assistance to minority enterprises, and it assisted our winner today. And the winner, as you know, the Entrepreneur of the Year Award is Mr. Liborio Hinojosa from Mercedes, Texas, the president of H & H Meat Products Company. He couldn't be here today, but it's a genuine pleasure to honor his entrepreneurial spirit, as well. Minority business is contributing to a stronger America, and this administration intends to encourage that. It's one reason we strongly support a bold initiative called Enterprise Zones, to stimulate business activity in some of the most destitute areas of our country. It's tragic that this legislation has been bottled up in the House of Representatives for so long. If the Congress refuses to act, hopes and dreams of millions will be lost in a cloud of indifference. I've directed the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency to assist in creating 60,000 new minority businesses and in expanding an additional 60,000 over the next 10 years. I've established a goal of $15 billion in Federal contract and subcontract awards to minority business over the next 3 years. An important tool is the 8(a) pilot program which gives a wider range of contracts to minority businesses. And I have designated the Department of Transportation to participate in this program. Federal procurement in the last year of the previous administration was $3.1 billion. Last year Federal procurement to minority business was approximately $4.4 billion. We're doing these things because we believe in minority small business. But my congratulations again to the winners, and it's especially good that we could honor them during the first annual Minority Enterprise Development Week. And I've signed many proclamations designating days and months and years and weeks particular things. But I was very delighted to be able to sign that particular proclamation. Again, God bless you all. Note: The President spoke at 1:20 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. Prior to the President's remarks, Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige presented the Minority Entrepreneur of the Year Award to Liborio Hinojosa. The plaque was accepted by his brother Rubin Hinojosa. James C. Sanders, Administrator of the Small Business Administration, then presented the SBA's Contractors of the Year Awards to Jaime Torres and Norris Carson. On August 11 the President signed Proclamation 5083, designating the week of October 2 through October 8, as Minority Enterprise Development Week, 1983.

<TITLE>Minority business enterprise - Wikipedia</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Minority business enterprise (MBE) is an American designation for businesses which are at least 51% owned, operated and controlled on a daily basis by one or more (in combination) American citizens of the following ethnic minority and/or gender (e.g. woman-owned) and/or military veteran classifications:[citation needed] According to the Minority Business Development Agency, minorities own more than 8 million firms, and account for nearly $1.4 trillion in revenues.[1] MBEs can self-identify, but are typically certified by a city, state or federal agency. Over $300 million were paid to many who self-identify as Cherokee.[2] Certain states within the United States, as a part of their bidding process, incentivize MBEs and women-owned business enterprises to bid on publicly awarded construction or service contracts. They may also declare that a percentage of the work performed on a contract be awarded to a MBE or women-owned business enterprise.[3][4][5] In New York, the goal for the award of public contracts is to increase from 20% in 2014 to 30% by 2019.[6] In 2018, the state was also considering establishing goals for the workforce of contractors awarded public contracts, but insisted these goals were not quotas. If contractors could not make a "good faith" effort to reach the goals, contractors might not be eligible for future public contracts for a length determined by the state.[7] In 2014, when New York increased its Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (MWBE) goals for public contracts from 20% to 30%, the Association of General Contractors (AGC) sued the state for failing to release documents via New York's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). The AGC was concerned that the state had not conducted a proper contract analysis before declaring the increase of the MWBE goal to 30%.[8] The AGC stated that the 30% goal does not reflect the availability of MWBEs statewide. The AGC also questioned a later study - performed by Mason Tillman Associates Ltd. of Oakland, California - that was paid for by the state in consideration of its employment goals for state contracts.[7] There have been cases where contractors have been charged with crimes for impersonating MBEs. In New York, the owner of Eastern Building & Restoration was sentenced to 3.5 to 12 years in prison for fraudulently receiving over $800,000 from public construction contracts for impersonating as an MBE from the years 2012 - 2014.[6][9] This article about ethics is a stub.

<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn  For a printable version (pdf) of this FAQ, click here. Small businesses are the backbone of the Washington economy. The majority of Washington employers are small private firms, and many are owned by minorities, women, and veterans. Small businesses provide jobs to about 51 percent of the state's private workforce - more than 1.3 million workers.1Strengthening opportunities for small and diverse businesses strengthens Washington's economy, supports our communities, improves the quality of life for everyone, and increases competition and innovation while lowering costs.  1 U.S. Small Business Administration 2018 Washington State Small Business Economic Profile  OMWBE maintains a Directory of Certified Firms that anyone can access. See video on how to use the OMWBEDirectory.WDVA maintains a List of Certified Veteran Owned Businesses, you can also find them in WEBS(Washingtons Electronic Business Solution).  There are five types of state certification through OMWBE: Details for the various certification requirements are available on the Certification pageof the OMWBE website.  If you have questions about certification, you can reach out to OMWBE via email TechnicalAssistance@omwbe.wa.govor by phone at (360) 664-9750. Our office hours are Monday-Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., excluding holidays. There is one type of state certification through WDVA: Requirements for certification are available on the Certification pageof the WDVA website.  If you have questions about Veteran Owned Business Certification please contact vob@dva.wa.govor (360) 725- 2169.    OMWBEs website lists supplier diversity reports and plansfor all state agencies and higher education institutions.  See the OMWBE Annual Report.  There could be a number of reasons. On the OMWBE website, you can see a detailed list of what diverse spending is countedand what is not counted. Here is an example:  While Travel does not count, if an agency does business with a certified travel agency, fees paid to the travel agent counts as use of a certified firm. The cost of the plane ticket does not count because the airline is not a certified firm. The same is true for car rentals, hotels, etc., when using a travel agent.  Subcontractor spend is only included in the dollars and percentages spent with minority business enterprises (MBE), women business enterprises (WBE), minority/women business enterprises (MWBE), combination business enterprises (CBE) or socially and economically disadvantaged business enterprises (SEDBE). However, this spending is not automatically included in the agencys overall spend. Agencies that track their subcontractor spend can report their subcontractor spend directly to OMWBE at the end of the states fiscal year and OMWBE adds it to the agency spend report. Example: The agency awards a contract to BIG Construction Company, a non-certified prime contractor, for $100,000. This $100,000 is represented in the overall spend. BIG Construction Company paid $20,000 to Small Business Masonry, an OMWBE certified MBE. The $20,000 payment by Big Construction Company counts as diverse certified spend for the agency.  OMWBE does not manage or verify these certifications so veteran and small business certifications are a separate line item on the supplier diversity report.  Please contact OMWBE at SupplierDiversity@omwbe.wa.govfor assistance. It could be that the certified firm was not certified during the reported fiscal year or the tax identification numbers the firm provided to the state Office of Financial Management may not match what is on record at OMWBE.   The Department of Enterprise Services does recognize there are occasions when the master contracts list cannot justifiably satisfy the agencys needs. Please refer to DES Pol-DES-090-00 FAQsand direct any questions to contractingandpurchasing@des.wa.govor call (360) 407-2210.

<TITLE>Surety Bonds | Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn Many public and private contracts require surety bonds, offered by surety companies. Surety bonds are a three-party agreement between the owner, contractor and surety company. A surety bond is like insurance and can cover subcontractors that have not been paid, damage that occurs from the project, or if a project is not completed within the requirements of the contract. Surety bonds can help small businesses win contracts by providing the customer with security that the contract will be completed. Bonds are most often required in the areas of construction, information technology, and other areas where the risk to the customer can be high. Surety bond premiums vary and typically range from 0.5% to 2% of the contract amount, or higher in the cases of high-risk businesses, and depend on size, duration of the project and contractor requirements. Requirements will differ from company to company. Generally, a business owner can expect to need, Businesses that have challenges qualifying for a surety bond with a surety company, can work with one of the programs below to improve their ability to qualify. The Small Business Administrations Surety Bond Program helps small and emerging business who have the knowledge and skills for success, but lack the experience and financial strength to obtain bonds through regular commercial channels. The program guarantees surety bonds for surety companies, which allows those companies to offer the bonds to small businesses who wouldnt qualify for commercial bonds without the guarantee. The Surety & Fidelity Association of America includes on its website, key information about surety and fidelity bonds. Resources include short videos, studies, links to local resources, as well as the booklets Why Get a Bond? and How to Get a Bond. The US Department of Transportation (DOT) Bonding Education Program (BEP) partners with The Surety & Fidelity Association of America (SFAA) to help small businesses become bond ready. The program is hands-on, multi-component and designed to address what businesses need to do to become bond-ready. It also includes one-on-one sessions with local surety bonding professionals to help gather the materials necessary for a complete bond application. This program is tailored to businesses competing for transportation-related contracts. The SFAA runs the Model Contractor Development Program with the same workshops and one-on-ones with other stakeholders for non-transportation-related contractors. In addition to providing the project owner the assurance that the contract will be performed, having a surety bond, and a strong relationship with a surety company that backs your business, has other advantages. Ensure the terms of a specific contract are fulfilled. Contract bonds are not the same thing as license bonds, which may be required as part of a license. Below are the primary types of contract surety bonds. Bid Bonds guarantee a contractor will enter into a contract if the bid is awarded and will provide the required performance and payment bonds. Performance Bonds guarantee the contractor will perform the work in the contract according to its terms. Payment Bonds guarantee the contractor will pay for services, especially subcontractors and materials. Maintenance Bonds guarantee the contractor will provide facility repair and upkeep for a certain time. Ensure all applicable laws and regulations are followed. Government agencies require certain companies or individuals to obtain commercial bonds, which protect the general public against things like fraud. License and Permit Bonds guarantee the license or permit holder will comply with laws and regulations. Examples include, plumbers, electricians, customs bond for importing, tax bonds, environmental protection bonds and more. Court Bonds guarantee the payment of costs in a proceeding or a court judgment. Fiduciary Bonds guarantee the carrying out of duties faithfully as prescribed by statute. Public Official Bonds guarantee the honesty and faithful performance of people elected or appointed to positions of trust. Miscellaneous Bonds guarantee other unique business needs not covered above. Examples include hazardous waste removal and self-insured workers compensation guarantee bonds. A surety bond to safeguard clients from theft. Most common in home health care, janitorial service and such. Why do companies need surety bonds? Some business is risky, especially construction. Over twenty percent (20%) of new construction firms fail in their first year. Even large established contractors can fail, with examples ranging from J. A. Jones to   Copyright 2021 by the Office of Minority & Women's Business Enterprises. All Rights Reserved. Terms of Service| Privacy Policy| Accessibility

Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn Washingtons diversity is one of its greatest economic and cultural strengths, yet in 2019 only 3.5 percent of the nearly $5 billion that the state spends with the private sector went to small and diverse businesses. The Governors Subcabinet for Business Diversity was formed in 2015 to address this issue, and conducted a statewide disparity study to determine the level of disparity in participation by small and diverse businesses in state contracts for public works, goods and services, and client services. The #1 recommendation of the disparity study is to implement an electronic data collection and monitoring system for state agencies and educational institutions to fully capture all of their diverse spending. The Business Diversity Management System (BDMS)is being implemented as part of a forward-thinking effort to modernize and standardize enterprise data collection and reporting. In addition to streamlining the reporting process for diversity spending, the BDMS will provide agencies with automated tools to identify and perform outreach to small and diverse businesses to share bidding opportunities. For the first time in state history, Governor Inslee directed state agencies to center their 2021-2023 budgetary packages and legislation proposals around equity. Through this direction, the Governor is putting agencies on a path to dismantle inequities in our systems and institutions, committing to a better life for all. Successful small and diverse businesses help make our economy and our families more resilient strengthening our communities and improving the quality of life for all Washingtonians. This directive supports the work carried out by the Governors Subcabinet for Business Diversity. OMWBE is working with B2Gnow to implement the Business Diversity Management System. B2Gnow is a nationally recognized business-to-government software provider that automates data-gathering, tracking, reporting, and vendor management.B2Gnow also maintains OMWBEs Directory of Certified Firms. This turn-key solution significantly reduces staff time and costs, allowing us to focus on helping public agencies meet their diversity goals. B2Gnow meets the guidelines provided by the One Washington program and is already being used by Department of Enterprise Services (DES), Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), the City of Seattle, the Port of Seattle, and Sound Transit. Contractors working with these departments are already familiar with the system and have vendor accounts, which will help make the transition easy for small and diverse businesses. B2Gnow also offers different modules that may become useful in the future. For the BDMS we will implement the Contract Compliance, Outreach & Event Management, and Utilization Planning modules in addition to the Certification module that is already operational.

<TITLE>Access to Capital - Access to Money | Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn Access to capital is how hard or easy it is for someone to get money or resources for their business. Most people need to access capital when starting or growing a business. The United States has a wide range of funding sources available to businesses. However, getting money for business can be a challenge for any person, let alone a member of a community that has faced discrimination and bias over generations. For example, many business owners use their homes, other real estate, or personal wealth to start up or grow their business. Communities of color have less wealth built up over generations due to systemic discrimination such as redlining (refusing to loan money to people living in certain areas). In addition, the evidence of bias and discrimination in the loan process still exist. To build strong businesses and strong communities, diverse small business owners need equitable access to capital. One solution to help small business owners is the Washington State Linked Deposit Loan Program. Started in 1983, it encourages banks and credit unions to offer better interest rates to owners of OMWBE certified businesses.

If you cannot find a certified business in your area of work, early planning will allow you to conduct market research and targeted outreach, and to receive technical assistance from OMWBE in this effort. Agencies should conduct outreach, consistent with their annual inclusion plans submitted to OMWBE, whether it is targeted for a specific contract OR for future needs. Below are some actions that you can take when you cant initially locate a certified business to supply the product or conduct the work you need. Monitor your agencys spend with small and diverse businesses throughout the year so you know what is working and can adjust your strategies as needed. You can access your agencys current small and diverse business spend data by following the Enterprise Reporting Guidelines.

<TITLE>Certifications | Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn Business owners get certifications for their businesses to verify information about the business. Certifications can be important to show who owns the business, where products come from, or how the business functions. To verify that a business is owned and controlled by a person or persons who are minorities, women, or socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, a business can get OMWBE state or federal certification. To learn more about OMWBE certifications, click here. There are three primary reasons business owners get their businesses certified. There are other reasons too. Business owners may get their businesses certified to show pride in their community or for local community recognition. OMWBE certification means that a business has been verified by a state agency as owned and controlled by minority, women and socially and economically disadvantaged persons. OMWBE is the sole agency that does state and federal certifications in Washington State. Self-identification is when a business registers as a vendor in an online system and the owner checks a box to show that they are minority or woman owned. This may or may not be verified. There are other organizations that certify businesses, often focused on the private sector and doing business with large companies. Visit our partner resources page to find out more.

<TITLE>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) | Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn  People are invited to submit questions about the disparity study and the Subcabinet work. To navigate through the FAQ, please click a link below:  Small businesses are the backbone of the Washington economy. The vast majority of Washington employers are small private firms, and many are minority-, women-, and veteran-owned. Small businesses provide jobs to about 51 percent of the state's private workforce - more than 1.3 million workers.[1] Strengthening opportunities for small and diverse businesses strengthens Washington's economy, supports our communities, improves the quality of life for everyone, and increases competition and innovation while lowering costs.  A disparity study is an analysis that examines the number of specified individuals or groupsavailable to participate in certain opportunities, such as obtaining contracts to provide goods and services, client services and public works for the state, and those who are actually selected. A disparity study also helps to determine whether the environment is fair and equitable to all parties seeking to participate in those opportunities.  Washington state launched the study to find out how we have been doing when it comes to including minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses in state contracts and contracting opportunities. Its purpose is to examine whether there were disparities inthe state's contracting awards. The study also looked at the amount these businesses might be expected to receive based on the number of such businesses available to perform the work among the total pool of eligible contractors. A disparity study provides a factual foundation that OMWBE can use to work with state agenciesto help improve the procurement processes to achievefair and equitable outcomes. The study will also helpclarify what tools state agencies can employ to ensure that our contracting practices are fair and nondiscriminatory. Read the study.  Race and gender neutral measures are activities or programs that benefit and assist all small businesses equally, including certified firms. These measures include things like aspirational goals, training, outreach, and technical assistance. Race and gender conscious measures, such as the use of required contract goals, are those targeted measures and programs that focus specifically on increasing diverse business participation.  Washington State must follow a prescriptive legal path to use a race or gender conscious measure to remedy discrimination. The Attorney Generals Office 2017 Opinion No 2 outlines the actions the state must take before implementing race and gender conscious goals. The state must demonstrate that race and gender-neutral measures have not resolved the discrimination before it can use race and gender-conscious measures. Enforceable goals are only allowed under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as a last resort.  Washington State has implemented various forms of race and gender neutral efforts. These efforts include, but are not limited to: While the state has made significant efforts to implement race and gender neutral programs, this has not been a statewide approach to inclusion. The Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises is leading the Governors Subcabinet on Business Diversity and is developing the tools to implement a statewide program through a Community of Practice.  The Governor can direct a Subcabinet made up of appropriate cabinet agencies to address a specific issue. Governor Jay Inslee chose 12agencies to participate in the Business Diversity Subcabinet. Six of these agencies make up two-thirds of the total state spend and includes key partner agencies, such as the state's ethnic commissions. The Governor's Subcabinet is working towardsolutions that are long-term and sustainable. Formingthe Subcabinet creates a "community of practice" where agencies can use model policies, practices, and processes to foster, cultivate and share best practices in increasing the use of small and diverse businesses.  The Minority and Womens Business Enterprise Program was created by the Legislature to provide the maximum practicable opportunity for increased participation by minority- and women-owned businesses for participation in public works contracts and the procurement of goods and service by state agencies and educational institutions. The Office of Minority and Womens Business Enterprises is the sole agency with the authority to certify women- and minority-owned firms.  The veteran-owned business program was created by the Legislature to encourage state agencies to conduct outreach to the veteran owned business community and increase the participation of veteran owned businesses in state contracting and procurement. Find out more about the program on the state Veteran's Affairs website.  It is a network for state procurement professionals to share best practices and ideas to increase use of certified minority-, women- and veteran-owned businesses. The Community of Practice is working on tools to implement supplier diversity best practices.   OMWBE will continue to work with state agencies on contracting and procurement with businesses owned by minorities, women, and veterans. Equity in public contracting is and continues to be a high priority for Governor Inslee and the work of the governors Business Diversity Subcabinet is ongoing.

<TITLE>Business Diversity Subcabinet Updates | Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprises</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Contact OMWBE: Contact UsFacebookTwitterLinkedIn The Subcabinet is preparing a phased roll out of supplier diversity tools and resources developed by its Community of Practice. The resources offer guidance on such topics as outreach to diverse firms, public works best practices, and ways to identify diverse business options in master contracts. The roll out will beginwith six state agencies of the Subcabinet that represent two-thirds of state spend. Workgroups supported by these agencies developed the tools to address such topics as outreach, master contracts, planning/forecasting and addressing internal processes. Their experience and feedback will lead to an enhanced tool that will be shared as additional state agencies are invited to join the Community of Practice beginning in 2020. OMWBE traveled across the state togather feedback on the Disparity Study and answer questions. Stops included Bellevue, Richland, Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, Vancouver, and Yakima.  (Photo courtesy of Flyright Productions) This roadmap is a high level representation of the steps toward changing the system to achieve greater supplier diversity. Starting with the launch of the Subcabinet itself, the roadmap shows the path toward using racial and gender neutral measures or a path that could lead to race and gender conscious measures.   The states Business Diversity Subcabinet received results from a Disparity Study that will assist in ongoing efforts to improve opportunities in government contracting for certified minority-, women- and veteran-owned businesses. We know communities of color, veterans and women face persistent barriers to state contracting opportunities. The Disparity Study is an important step on our path to improve, said Subcabinet Administrative Director Rex Brown. The Subcabinet was formed in 2015 by Gov. Jay Inslee to address inequities in state contracting and procurement practices. The Subcabinet and state agencies are still reviewing the results of the study. Washington will use the study information along with a new diversity framework developed by the Subcabinet to refine its approach to improving utilization of small and diverse businesses. We wanted to release the study right away so that interested organizations and community members could take some time to digest it and formulate any questions theyd like to see answered as well, said Chris Liu, Director for the state Department of Enterprise Services, the agency that oversaw the study contract on behalf of the state. The Subcabinet is planning a series of informational meetings throughout the state to discuss the study and next steps.

Our pick for: Cash back flat-rate rewards + no annual fee The no-fuss, no-hassle rewards of the Discover it Business Card make it a great choice for entrepreneurs and side hustlers whose business expenses don't fall into the bonus categories on other small-business rewards cards (things like office supplies, advertising and so on).

Our pick for: Travel rewards bonus categories + big sign-up offer The Ink Business Preferred Credit Card starts you off with one of the biggest sign-up bonuses of any credit card anywhere (assuming you spend enough to earn it), then gives you bonus rewards in common business spending categories.

The card offers a great sign-up bonus, too. Read our review. Our pick for: Travel rewards premium rewards and perks Like the consumer version of this card, The Business Platinum Card from American Express comes with a big annual fee. But business travelers who prefer to go in style will find plenty that appeals to them: high rewards on certain travel purchases, bonus rewards on larger non-travel purchases, a superb newcomer bonus offer, extensive airport lounge access, elite hotel status, hundreds of dollars a year in available credits and a list of perks as long as your arm.

Our pick for: Intro APR + AmEx points The Blue Business Plus Credit Card from American Express is a near-twin to the American Express Blue Business Cash Card, with one key difference: Rather than cash back, it pays you in AmEx Membership Rewards points. Read our review. Our pick for: Intro APR + cash-back rewards The American Express Blue Business Cash Card boasts one of the better introductory APR offers among business credit cards. Beyond that, you earn a solid cash-back rate (at least for a while the rate drops after you hit a spending threshold). There's no annual fee, but there's no new-cardholder bonus offer either. Read our review. Our pick for: Flexible financing Businesses with high working capital needs but sometimes inconsistent cash flow might find The Plum Card from American Expressa perfect fit. Pay early and get a discount, or enjoy up to 60 days without interest. Terms apply. There's a substantial annual fee, but if you're using the card for, say, big inventory purchases, the benefits could far outweigh the costs. Read our review. Our pick for: Airline credit card for business If your business has you on the road a lot, you'll appreciate the airport lounge access on the Delta SkyMiles Reserve Business American Express Card, which includes both Delta's own Sky Clubs and American Express's Centurion Lounges when flying Delta. The annual companion certificate which is good even in first class and the checked-bag benefit add considerable value, too. Terms apply.Read our review. Our pick for: Hotel credit card for business The Marriott Bonvoy Business American Express Card can pay for itself just with the automatic free night's stay every year. Add in automatic elite status, generous rewards, a dandy welcome bonus and more, and it's hard to go wrong. Terms apply.Read our review. Our pick for: Fair credit The rewards rate on the Capital One Spark Classic for Business isn't going to wow anyone, there's no sign-up bonus and the APR is high. What makes this card valuable is that it's available to business operators with fair or "average" credit, who don't have a lot of options in business credit cards especially with no annual fee. Read our review. Our pick for: No personal guarantee Unlike most cards designed for entrepreneurs, the Brex Card doesn't require the cardholder to personally guarantee the debt on the card. Instead, Brex determines creditworthiness by evaluating a company's cash balance, spending patterns and investors. It's a good option when a business owner has a thin credit file but is well-capitalized. The card earns rewards, too. Read our review.  The term "small business" is often associated with enterprises like a corner store, an accountant's office or a landscaping company. But small-business cards can make sense for anyone who is in business for him- or herself, whether it's a full-time job,freelancing, gig work or a side hustle. You don't need to be incorporated or have a formal business structure,like an LLC or partnership. Most entrepreneurs are "sole proprietors" sole proprietorships account for about three-quarters of all businesses in the U.S. and they're eligible to apply for small-business credit cards. Why get a small-business credit card? Small-business cards help you keep business and personal finances separate. When you use the card only for business spending, interest and fees on the card can be tax-deductible business expenses. And small-business cards offer rewards, perks and bonuses that rival (and in many cases surpass) those on consumer credit cards. Applications for small-business credit cards are a lot like those for consumer cards, with a few important differences. The application may ask for: A business name. If you don't have a formal business name, this can just be your name. When you're a sole proprietor, you literally are the business. Business contact information.If you don't have a separate business address and phone number, don't sweat it. Your personal address and phone number are just fine. A federal Taxpayer Identification Number.Don't get intimidated by this term. Your Social Security number is a federal tax ID number, and if you're a sole proprietor, you can put that down. If you have employees or a formal business structure, you'll probably have an Employer Identification Number, and you can use that. The industry you're in.What do you do in your business? This can be a broad category like retail, medical or professional services, or something more specific. If you're stumped for the proper way to describe it, think about the service you provide. Drive for Uber? That's transportation. DoorDash or Grubhub? That's delivery. How long you've been in business. Revenue and expenses.Revenue is simply how much money you brought in from your business. Expenses are all the money you spent in to earn that money. A formal business structure.The application will ask you to specify what kind of business it is. If your business is organized as a corporation, partnership or LLC, put that down. If you operate without a formal or legal business structure, that's fine, too. You can put down "sole proprietor." An existing business credit history. Although businesses can have credit histories and credit scores of their own (more on that below), a separate business credit file isn't necessary to qualify for a small-business credit cards. That's because most cards require you to personally guarantee the debts of the business (also discussed below). In other words, business credit cards for startups are available card based on your personal credit history and credit scores. How long does it take to get a small-business credit card?The card issuer will need to review your personal and business credit history. While some business credit cards advertise near-instant approval, you may need to wait a couple weeks for your card if your credit isn't excellent. Business and consumer credit cards differ in a fewcritical ways.Heres what you should know before applying. Virtually all small-business credit card applications include personal guarantees,where you agree to be personallyliable for the debt accrued. This means youre responsible for the balances even if yourbusiness goes belly-up. Keep this in mind when applying and avoid borrowing more than youre able to pay back. When you apply for a small business credit card, the application willprobably show up as an inquiry on your personal credit report, whichcancost youa few points on your credit scores for a short time. Thats because your issuer wants to make sure that you, the business owner, are personally on solid financial footing before letting you borrow money. If your credit history is thin or poor, bad credit business credit cards are available. After that, small business cards generally fall into two categories: some report your account payment history only to commercial credit bureaus,while othersreport to bothconsumer and commercial bureaus.In the latter case,your good or bad spending habits on your small business credit card could affect both your personal and business credit. As a courtesy, issuers today generally extend many consumer protections for personal credit cards to small-business credit cards. But the law doesnt require them to do so. The consumer-friendly Credit Card Act of 2009 set important limits on fees, interest calculations and disclosures for personal credit cards, but it doesnt cover small-business credit cards. There are two types of business credit cards: small-business cards and corporate cards. If youre just starting out and your revenue is in the thousands, not the millions, youll likely want to go with a small business credit card, the kind featured on this list. Once you hit the big time, you might want to switch over to a corporate card. This wouldlimit your personal financial liability for the account. Businesses can have credit scores just like individuals. When you're just getting a business off the ground, you'll probably have to rely on your personal credit toopen a small-business credit card or obtain a loan. But asa business builds itscredit over time, it becomes easier to secure financing separate from the owner's personal credit, as well as qualify for a business insurance policy.  MORE: How to build business credit Below are keydifferences between business credit scores and personal credit scores. Likeconsumer credit scores, business scores are generated by credit reporting bureaus companies that collect information about debts and then use that information to estimate how risky it would be to lend money to a person or, in this case, a business. The higher the score, the lower the risk. The main consumer credit reporting bureaus are Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The main bureaus for business scores are Dun & Bradstreet, Equifax and Experian. Consumer credit scoring systems typically have a score range of 300 to 850. The range for business scores is usually 0 to 100. Consumer credit bureaus collect information independently from each other, but they use similar algorithms to calculate scores. As a result, your personal scores are likely to be similar, even if not identical, from one bureau to the next.Business credit score algorithms dont follow an industry standard and can vary from bureau to bureau. Federal law gives you the right to a free copy ofyour personalcredit report from each of the three major consumer credit bureaus once every 12 months. Further, you canget free access toyour personal credit score in a number of ways (including from NerdWallet). Not so for business credit. Youll have to pay to see your companys credit report and score at the major business credit bureaus. Only you andcertain companieshave the right to see your personal credit reports and scores. But with business credit reports, all information is public, and you can get information on other companies as long as you're willing to pay for it.  MORE: Business credit score basics Chances are, you'lluse your small-business credit card quite a bit, so make sure youre getting one with favorable terms. Heres how: If you plan on carrying balances from month to month,getting a card with a 0% APRperiod or low ongoing interest is more important than searching for generous rewards. Alternatively, if you plan on paying in full every month, a card with a big sign-up bonus and lucrative rewards could be a perfect fit. If earning big rewards is your goal, start by looking at your costs. For businesses that spend plenty on travel and office supplies, a card thatgives bonus rewards inthose categories would be an excellent choice.And for companies with spending that doesn't fit into the usual categories, a flat-rate rewards card wouldfit the bill.  Confused about miles andpointsprograms? Seewhat theserewardsare worth and read about how these programs work with our guide to travel rewards programs. Some cards come with programs that allow you to match photos of receipts to your card purchases in-app. Many also offer free employee cards and itemized end-of-year statements that help at tax time. For more, see our guide to choosing a business credit card As you narrow down your choices based on your business's needs, here's how to evaluateand compare thefeatures of different cards. Many of the best small-business credit cards charge an annual fee, often in the $100 range. The rewards youearn from your spendingcan easily make up for it, so don't dismiss the idea of paying a fee out of hand. High-volume businesses, especially, can earn rewards that dwarf the fee. If you spend $200,000 a year on a card with a 2% rewards rate, for example, that's $4,000 a year in rewards, well worth a $100 fee.If you're spending that much, an annual fee may also indicate a high-limit business credit card though your actual credit line will depend on your creditworthiness. Annual fees are also deductible business expenses. But if you're 100% opposed to paying a fee, there are fine no-fee options available. If you opt for a rewards credit card, you'll have two choices to make. The first is whether you want a flat-rate card or a bonus-category card: Flat-rate cards pay you the same rewards on every purchase, regardless of what you buy or where. If you want simplicity, or if your business's expenses tend to run the gamut without any particular category predominating, then a flat-rate card may be best for you. Bonus-category cards pay a higher rewards rate in certain categories and a lower base rate on everything else. If you don't mind (or if you enjoy) keeping track of categories and moving spending around to maximize your return, then these cards may be right for you. A bonus category card is an excellent choice if you spend a lot of money in just a few areas. Typical bonus categories for business credit cards include things like office supplies, travel, telecommunications, advertising and shipping. The second choice is whether you want your rewards as cash back or points. Cash-back cards pay you back a certain percentage of every purchase. Flat-rate cards tend to offer 1% to 2% back spend $1,000 on something, get $10 to $20 back. Bonus-category cards go as high as 5%. Cash back is most commonly redeemed as a credit against your account. Points cards give you points or miles for each dollar you spend, either at a flat rate or with bonus points in certain categories. These rewards can usually be redeemed for travel, though you may have other options, such as merchandise or cash back. A number ofcards offer a lower interest rate, often 0%, when you first open the account. The 0% period may last a year or more. This can be of great benefit if you have a major business-related purchase you're looking to finance. If you plan to pay your credit card bill in full each month, then the ongoing APR doesn't have to be a major factor in your decision. That's because you'll pay no interest. But if you expect to carry a balance from month to month, the ongoing interest rate becomes very important. Interest charges can easily eat up the value of your rewards, so prioritize a lower ongoing APR if you're going to be carrying debt. Somesmall-business credit cards offer special financing options, such as a discount if you pay early or the ability to set up installmentplansto pay off specific charges. These can be useful if your business is seasonal or subject to irregular cash flow. If you're earning rewards, you'll want to get as much company spending on the card as possible. Many issuers allow you to getadditional cards at no extra cost for employees who are authorized to spend money on behalf of the business. You also may be able to set spending limits or other restrictions on employee cards. It's helpful if the issuer offers tools to help you track and categorize expenses. For example, you may be able to download transaction data into bookkeeping software. Or you could match photos of receipts to transactions. Or you may get a detailed annual report for use in preparing your taxes. If your business has you traveling a lot, look for a card that can make your trip more comfortable. Co-branded airline and hotel cards offer special status and upgrades. Some cards give you access to airport lounges. Others provide travel insurance or rental car coverage for peace of mind. Forentrepreneurs who pay in full every month and don't overspend, using a rewards credit card for everything makes thosepoints, miles or cash backadd up fast. Avoid paying with a credit card when a convenience charge is added, if possible. Toget your card's sign-up bonus, you typically need to make a few thousand dollars' worth of purchases in the first few months after opening the account.Check your card's terms and track your spending to make sure you dont miss out. Readyour credit card statements and make a note of when your promotional offer expires to avoid unpleasant surprises. If youre using your card for business costs, fees and interest count as business expenses. That means you can deduct them at tax time.

Last updated on June 10, 2021 NerdWallet's Credit Cards team selects the best credit cards for small business basedon overall consumer value, as evidenced by star ratings, as well as their suitability for specific kinds ofsmall-business operators.Factors in our evaluation include annual and other fees, rewards rates, the earning structure (for example, flat-rate rewards versus bonus categories), redemption options, bonus offers for new cardholders, introductory and ongoing APRs, andother noteworthyfeatures such as special financing arrangements, free cards for employees or tools for managing business expenses. The fundamental difference between a small-business credit card and a corporate credit card lies in who is responsible for debts on the card:  With a small-business card, the business owner is personally responsible for the debt. That means he or she is liable for paying the debt even if the business goes under.  With a corporate card, the business itself is the debtor. If the company goes out of business, the owners are not personally responsible for paying the debt. This difference is reflected in the application process for business credit cards. When you apply for a small-business credit card, the issuer will check your personal credit history as well as your businesss credit (if your business even has a credit file of its own, which many dont). Youll also be expected to provide a personal guarantee that youll repay any debt.For a corporate card, the issuer examines only the businesss credit standing. The owners and operators dont have to provide a personal guarantee. Because of this, corporate cards are an option primarily forcompanies that have already established a credit history separate from the owners. The biggest difference between business and consumer credit cards, of course, is that you must operate a business to qualify for a business card. Beyond that:  Consumer protections that apply to personal credit cards dont necessarily apply to business cards. This includes things like limits on fees and rules about when the issuer can change the interest rate.  Activity on small-business credit cards can be reported on the credit histories of both the business and the cardholder.  Credit limits on business cards tend to be higher.  Rewards structures are different, particularly the categories that earn bonus rewards. A business credit card is more likely to earn bonus rewards on shipping or at office-supply stores, for example, than at supermarkets or movie theaters. In general, you must operate a business to qualify a small-business credit card, but that business does not have to be incorporated or even have a formal structure, such as a partnership or LLC. If youre a sole proprietor, freelancer or gig worker, you can apply for a small-business card, too. Be aware, though, that the application will likely ask specific questions about your business the name (if it has one), what kind of business it is, how much revenue it brings in, and so on. The effect a business credit card has on your credit score depends on what type of card it is. A corporate card issued to you by your employer has no effect, because all account activity is reported on the employers credit file, not yours. Really, a corporate card is nothing but a tool you use for your job youre not on the hook for the debt. But if its a small-business card that you applied for yourself, the activity on the account could show up on your credit report and could affect your score, especially if the activity is negative, such as a missed payment or default. The application for a small-business credit card will typically ask for the tax identification number of the business. If you have an EIN, you can use that. But you dont need an EIN. If youre a sole proprietor, you can use your Social Security number. Either way, the application will also ask for information about the individual who is personally guaranteeing the debt. Youll use your Social Security number for that. Updated Disclaimer: NerdWallet strives to keep its information accurate and up to date.

You typically need a year or more of history and revenue to qualify for financing. Startups operating for less than a year can considerother financing options. The government-guaranteed SBA loan program works with banks to offer low interest rates and long-term repayment. But the process is time-consuming, and the requirements are strict. Only those with good personal credit (690 or higher, although some SBA lenders may have lower score requirements), strong business finances and the flexibility to wait for funding should apply. The SBA also administered the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to help small-business owners keep employees on the payroll. The general fund for PPP loans ran out of money on May 4, 2021. New applications from Community Financial Institutions, which service underserved communities, will still be processed. But new PPP loan applications from other lenders will not be processed. The PPP loan program officially expires on May 31, 2021. Online lenders offer term loans of up to $500,000. For a short-term loan, the repayment period typically ranges from three to 18 months, while a long-term loan repayment can extend up to 10 years or longer in some cases. Business owners can also find financing that can be used for specific items, like equipment or inventory. A business line of credit provides access to flexible cash. Similar to a credit card, lenders give you access to a specific amount of credit (say, $100,000), but you dont make payments or get charged interest until you tap into the funds. Invoice factoring turns business owners unpaid invoices into immediate cash. You sell the invoices to a factoring company, which is paid when it collects from your customers. If you prefer to maintain control over your invoices, invoice financing is an alternative to factoring. Time to funding can be relatively short with invoice factoring or financing. Business financing options other than traditional loans or lines of credit include personal loans for business or business credit cards. Apersonal loan for business is a good option if your business is still young and you dont qualify for traditional financing. Personal-loan providers look at your personal credit score and income instead of your business history. A business credit card offers revolving credit, making it a solid option for short-term expenses. It can also be easier to qualify for a business credit card than a small-business loan. While credit limits tend to be smaller than a line of credit, a business credit card may offer rewards, such as cash back or travel points. Every lender has different underwriting guidelines, but they generally consider similar factors, including personal credit score, your time in business and annual revenue. Lenders also consider your cash flow and ability to repay the debt. Banks that offer small-business loans typically require a strong personal credit score (starting in the 700s), several years in business and a solid track record of business finances such as strong cash flow. In some cases, banks will require collateral. Depending on the lender, youll be asked to share financial documents like tax returns, and bank and cash-flow statements. Read more about how to get a small-business loan. Having strong personal credit can help you qualify for lower rates and give you more financing options. If you dont need business financing right away, consider building your credit score. If you dont know your credit score or want to monitor it consistently, several personal finance websites, including NerdWallet, offer free credit score access. Track your progress and open more doors for financing your business. Only about 1 in 5 businesses that apply for a loan from a big bank are approved.

Digital Federal Credit Union has branch locations in Massachusetts and New Hampshire if youre local to the area. Here are some things to keep in mind as compare your options: Consider your short- and long-term financial goals. If you think your businesss needs will change drastically in a year, you dont want to choose a bank that wont be able to accommodate you after that year. Think about how you prefer to bank. Are you going to turn your search exclusively to brick-and-mortar banks or are online banks an option? Look for the product features or services that are most important to you. If a business checking account is your top priority, narrow down your search to find the best checking account options for your business. On the other hand, if you want to bundle multiple products at once, find a bank that can provide those services. Dont forget about fees. Make sure you understand the fees associated with any business account and explore multiple options before signing up. Start, but dont end, your search with your personal bank. According to a 2019 study from BAI, a research and training nonprofit for business owners, 79% of small-business owners reported using the same provider for their personal and business financial services. The same study points out, however, that business owners have a net promoter score, which measures customer satisfaction, of 24, lower than that of general banking consumers, whose net promoter score is 35. While it might be easy to start your search with your personal bank, it might be worth exploring alternative banks as well.

MORE:Find the best working capital loans Traditional bank loans typically require collateral, such as your home or other personal asset, to secure a loan. OnDeck doesnt. Banks often want borrowers to have a personal credit score of 720 or higher; OnDecks minimumis 600. A typical OnDeck borrower has the following: Personal credit scores of 680 to 720. Annual revenue exceeding $500,000. Time in business of between four to six years.  MORE:Compare business loans for bad credit OnDecks term loans have a one-time origination fee between 2.5% to 4% ofthe total loan amount on your first loan. This fee drops to 1.25% to 3% on your second loan and to 0% to 3% on your third and future loans. OnDeck reports your payment activity to the business credit bureaus Equifax, Experian and PayNet. Making timely payments shouldbuild your business credit, which could help you get larger and less expensive small-business loans in the future. OnDecks term loans carry APRs ranging from 9% to 99%, while rates for its lines of credit range from 11% to 61.9%, according to OnDeck regulatory filings.Rates change slightly each quarter. These APRs include origination fees on its term loans and a $20 monthly maintenance fee for the lines of credit. The maintenance fee is waived for the first six months if you draw $5,000 or more within the first five days of opening the credit line. There are no fees to draw money.

Failure to repay could damage your personal credit score. OnDeck deducts a fixed daily or weekly payment from your business bank account. Term loans are repaid daily or weekly, while lines of credit are repaid weekly. Businesses with uneven cash flow should be aware of the frequent repayments. OnDeck doesnt assess prepayment penalties, but repaying its term loans early wont save you money because the lender requires customers pay a fixed amount of fees. This differs from small-business loans that require monthly payments of principal and interest based on an amortization schedule. Borrowers who repay amortizing loans early save on interest. OnDeck works with most types of small businesses such as doctors, dentists, restaurants, auto body shops and beauty salons that have annual revenues from $100,000 to $5 million. Heres alistof businesses it wont lend to, includingdrug dispensaries and car dealers.

All of our recommendations are based on the lenders market scope and track record and on the needs of business owners, as well as rates and other factors, so you can make the right financing decision. OnDeck reports payment activity to each of the three business credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and PayNet. Making timely payments on your loan can build your business credit, which may help you qualify for cheaper financing and larger loans. OnDeck provides funding as fast as the same business day after approval, carries looser qualifications than traditional banks, and it may reduce its origination fee for repeat customers. OnDeck is a direct provider of business loans and does not offer peer-to-peer lending, which allows you to borrow directly from an individual or a group of investors instead of a lender.
